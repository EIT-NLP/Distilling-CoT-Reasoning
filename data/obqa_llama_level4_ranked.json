When an object's potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, it means that the object's stored energy is being released and used to generate motion. A resting bird has potential energy due to its position, but it is not converting that potential energy into kinetic energy because it is not moving. A still rock also has potential energy due to its position, but it too is not converting that potential energy into kinetic energy because it is not moving. Our own sun generates its enormous amount of heat and light through nuclear reactions in its core, which does not involve the conversion of potential to kinetic energy.

        "output": "The distance from Earth to Mars varies as both planets follow elliptical orbits around the sun. At their closest, the distance is about 56 million kilometers, and at their farthest, it's about 401 million kilometers. Let's assume an average distance of 200 million kilometers. The fastest spacecraft to travel to Mars is NASA's Perseverance rover, which has a speed of about 24,600 km/h. To find the time, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we get time = 200,000,000 km / 24,600 km/h. This is approximately 8,138 hours. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply 8,138 hours by 3600 seconds/hour to get the total number of seconds. This is approximately 29,298,880,000 seconds.
