Since Adam has 4 more than Jackie, if we subtract 4 from the total number of apples (14), and then divide by 2, we'll find how many apples Jackie has. This gives us (14 - 4) / 2 = 5 apples for Jackie.  Next, we find how many apples Adam has. Knowing Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 4 more, we add 4 to Jackie's total, giving us 5 + 4 = 9 apples for Adam.  We know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together.  To find this number, we add the number of apples Adam has (9) and the number of apples Jackie has (5) to get 9 + 5 = 14 apples.  Then, we add 6 to the total to find how many apples Bob has: 14 + 6 = 20 apples for Bob.  The answer is 20"

We know Nell started with 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, totaling 665 cards (309 + 356).  After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 cards remaining.  Therefore, Nell gave away 250 cards (665 - 415).  We don't know exactly how many of each type of card she gave away, but we know she had more Ace cards than baseball cards initially. So, it's likely she gave away more Ace cards than baseball cards.   To find the difference, we can subtract the total number of cards left from the initial number of baseball cards: 309 - 415 = -106. This means she has 106 fewer baseball cards than she started with.  Since she has 415 cards left and gave away 250 cards, she must have 165 Ace cards left (415 - 250).  The difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards is 266 (309 - 165).  The answer is 266"

We cannot have a negative number of trees, so we know there was an error in our calculation. Since 13 trees died, this indicates that Haley had more trees than the initial 3 that she grew. We need to consider a scenario where the initial 3 trees survive and the extra trees are the ones that died.  To find out how many more trees died than survived, we subtract the number of surviving trees from the number of dead trees: 13 trees - 3 trees = 10 trees.  Therefore, 10 more trees died than survived.  However, the question asks for the difference between the dead trees and the surviving trees. We need to think about the difference between 13 and 3.  The difference between 13 and 3 is 10.  The answer is 10"

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of cakes made and sold: 19 cakes - 70 cakes = -51 cakes.  Since the number of cakes sold is more than the number of cakes made, we will have a negative result.  Finally, we add the number of pastries and cakes to find the difference: 43 pastries + (-51 cakes) = -8 pastries.  Since the result is negative, it means the baker made 8 more cakes than pastries.  Therefore, the baker made 8 more cakes than pastries.  The answer is 8"

Assuming the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches, which is impossible.  We will assume that the frog jumped 25 inches less than the grasshopper, which would make the frog jump 21 - 25 = -4 inches. This is impossible.  Let's assume that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. So, the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches. This is not possible. Assuming the grasshopper jumped 25 inches **less** than the frog, the frog jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches.  The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches.

Since there were 14 children on the bus in the end, this means 14 children got on the bus.  Now, to find out how many more children got on than got off, we subtract the number who got off from the number who got on: 14 children - 63 children = -49 children. Since we can't have negative children, this tells us that 49 more children got off the bus than got on.
