What was the total number of children on the bus after some children got on? After the children got on, there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How can we set up the equation based on the information provided? We can set up the equation: Initial number of children + children who got on - children who got off = number of children altogether: 5 + X - 63 = 14 How can the equation be simplified to find X? Simplify the equation to find X: X - 58 = 14. What is the value of X from the simplified equation? X = 72. Therefore, 72 children got on the bus.
