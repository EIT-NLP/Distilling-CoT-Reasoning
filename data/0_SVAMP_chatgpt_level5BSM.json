What is the total amount of flour needed and how do we determine the flour still needed? The total flour needed is 6 cups. The flour still needed is the total flour required minus the flour already added: 6 - F_added = F. How do we determine the sugar still needed based on the total amount required? The total sugar needed is 13 cups. The sugar still needed is the total sugar required minus the sugar already added: 13 - S_added = S. How do we substitute the sugar equation into the flour equation?

After spending $9, Edward had (X - 9) dollars left. How much did Edward have after spending $8 more? Then, he spent $8 more, so he had (X - 9 - 8) dollars left. How much money does Edward have now? We are given that after spending the money, he now has $17. What is the corresponding equation set up to solve this problem? Set up the equation: X - 9 - 8 = 17. How do we simplify the equation? Simplify the left side of the equation: X - 17 = 17. What is the final step to find X? Add 17 to both sides of the equation: X = 17 + 17. How much did Edward have initially? Therefore, X = 34.

Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, so Steven's peaches can be represented as S = J + 11. What is the equation to find Jill's peaches? Plugging in Steven's peaches, we get 4 = J + 11. How do we solve for Jill's peaches? Solving for J, we find J = 4 - 11, thus J = -7. How do we represent the number of peaches Jake has in relation to Steven's peaches? Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can represent Jake's peaches as K = S - 12. What is the value of Jake's peaches? Plugging in Steven's peaches, we get K = 4 - 12 = -8. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake? J - K = -7 - (-8) = -7 + 8 = 1.The answer is 1"

At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus. What is the unknown number of children that got on the bus? Let the number of children who got on the bus be X. What was the total number of children on the bus after some children got on? After the children got on, there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How can we set up the equation based on the information provided? We can set up the equation: Initial number of children + children who got on - children who got off = number of children altogether: 5 + X - 63 = 14 How can the equation be simplified to find X? Simplify the equation to find X: X - 58 = 14. What is the value of X from the simplified equation? X = 72. Therefore, 72 children got on the bus. How can we determine the number of children who got on the bus compared to those who got off?
