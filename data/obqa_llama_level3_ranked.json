        "output": "The distance from Earth to Mars varies as both planets follow elliptical orbits around the sun. At their closest, the distance is about 56 million kilometers. At their farthest, the distance is about 401 million kilometers. Let's assume an average distance of 200 million kilometers. The fastest spacecraft to travel to Mars is NASA's Persehverance Rover, which has a speed of about 24,600 km/h. To find the time, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we get time = 200,000,000 km / 24,600 km/h. This is approximately 8,138 hours. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply 8,138 hours by 3600 seconds/hour to get the total number of seconds. This is approximately 29,298,880,000 seconds.
