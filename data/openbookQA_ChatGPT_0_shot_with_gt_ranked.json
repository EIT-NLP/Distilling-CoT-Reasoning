        "output": " First, consider the masses of each option.  A metric ton of marbles has a fixed mass, but it is relatively small compared to celestial bodies.  A blue whale and its calf together also have a considerable mass but far less than any celestial bodies.  Jupiter and all its moons represent a massive celestial body and thus have significant gravity, much more than the previous two options.  Finally, a ball of burning gas in our solar system (likely referring to the Sun) has an enormous mass and gravity due to its position as the dominant star in our system.  Comparing all the options, the ball of burning gas in our solar system (the Sun) has the most gravity.  The answer is D"

A lizard building a 40-foot wide hole is highly unlikely as it wouldn't result in a ball-shaped hole. The moon's gravity pulling sand out is also implausible given the scale. A dust storm filling in a hole contradicts the evidence of a hole being present. Something from space entering the atmosphere, such as a meteorite, is consistent with the shape and scale of a 40-foot wide impact crater. The answer is A"

        "output": "Placing an egg on a pillow will not exert significant force on it, so the egg's shape and mass will remain unchanged. Dropping an egg from a building is likely to result in the egg breaking, which will change its shape and potentially its mass as parts of it may scatter. Leaving an egg in a carton provides it with a secure and stable environment, thus not affecting its shape or mass. Holding an egg in your hand is gentle and will not change the egg's shape or mass. The answer is B"
