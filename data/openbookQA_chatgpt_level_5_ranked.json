A bathtub is a container, not a heat source, and thus cannot boil water. Therefore, embers are the correct answer. The answer is C"

When flocks relocate, they are moving from one area to another, which fits the concept of migration.Deer breeding is related to reproduction, not migration.When geese honk, it is a form of communication, not related to moving from one place to another.When mice scurry, they are moving quickly but not relocating to a new distant place.Therefore, the answer is A"
