Since Pr^2 = 40, the difference in compound interest would be 6 * 40 = 240. However, we are asked for the difference in the compound interest in year 1 and year 2, not the total compound interest. This difference is 3 times the original difference of $40, which is 3*40 = $120.The answer is D."

The area of the smaller square is x^2, and the area of the larger square is (x + 8)^2. The combined area of the two squares is x^2 + (x + 8)^2 = 1000. Expanding the equation, we get x^2 + x^2 + 16x + 64 = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x^2 + 16x - 936 = 0. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x^2 + 8x - 468 = 0.

If you walk 10 steps, you reach the ground in 20 minutes. This also means you walked 0.5 steps per minute (10 steps / 20 minutes).\n\nSince the elevator is moving at a constant speed, we need to figure out the elevator's speed.

This means the elevator moves at 1 step per minute (10 steps / 10 minutes).\n\nNow let's find out how many steps there are in total.  Since the elevator moves at 1 step per minute, and it takes 10 minutes to travel 20 steps (20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps per minute), there are a total of 20 steps.\n\nTherefore, the elevator moves at 1 step per minute, and there are 20 steps. \nThe answer is A"

To find the cost of hiring the student and janitor together, we would multiply 40/7 hours by $28 per hour. The difference between the two costs would be $8. \nThe answer is E"

        "output": "\nLet x be the percentage of people who like both candidates.  Then 2x is the percentage who like only one candidate.  Since 33% like A and 51% like B, we know that 33% - x + 2x = 51% - x + 2x = 100% - (percentage of people who like neither).  This simplifies to 33% + x = 51% + x = 100% - (percentage of people who like neither).  Solving for x, we get x = 18.

Since A runs 1 km in 4.5 minutes, we can find out how many meters B runs in 4.5 minutes:  200 meters/minute * 4.5 minutes = 900 meters. \n\nA runs 1000 meters in 4.5 minutes, while B runs 900 meters in 4.5 minutes.  So, A needs to give B a 100 meter head start (1000 - 900 = 100). \nThe answer is D"

Therefore, we have 144 - the number of people who cannot do any of the things = 55 + 48 + 53 - |S ∩ D| - |S ∩ C| - |D ∩ C| + 6. \nSimplifying, we get the number of people who cannot do any of the things = 162 - |S ∩ D| - |S ∩ C| - |D ∩ C|. \nSince |(S ∩ D) ∪ (S ∩ C) ∪ (D ∩ C)| = 37, we know that |S ∩ D| + |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ C| - |S ∩ D ∩ C| = 37. \nPlugging this into our equation, we get the number of people who cannot do any of the things = 162 - (37 + 6) = 162 - 43 = 119. \nTherefore, the answer is 144 - 119 = 25.The answer is C"

        "output": "Let x be the number of corsages sold for $20 and y be the number of corsages sold for $30.  We know that 20x + 30y = the store's revenue. If 8 of the $30 corsages were sold for $20, the revenue would have been 20(x + 8) + 30(y - 8). The problem states that this revenue is 35% less than the actual revenue, so 20(x + 8) + 30(y - 8) = 0.65(20x + 30y).  Expanding this equation gives 20x + 160 + 30y - 240 = 13x + 19.5y. Combining like terms, we get 7x + 10.5y = 80. Dividing both sides by 3.5, we get 2x + 3y = 22.67. Since x and y must be integers, we can guess and check to find the values of x and y that satisfy this equation.  We can see that x = 5 and y = 4 work.  The actual revenue from corsages that day was 20(5) + 30(4) = 100 + 120 = $220.  The actual revenue is then 220/0.65 = $338.46, which is approximately $320. \nThe answer is A."

        "instruction": "Two people are playing with a pair of dice. Instead of numbers, the dice have different colors on their sides. The first person wins if the same color appears on both the dice and the second person wins if the colors are different. The odds of their winning are equal. If the first dice has 5 red sides and 1 blue side, find the colour(s) on the second one. Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 7",
        "output": "For the odds to be equal, the probability of getting the same color should be equal to the probability of getting different colors.  The probability of getting the same color (red) on both dice is 5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36. This is the same as the probability of getting different colors, which is 1/6 * 1/6 + 5/6 * 1/6 + 1/6 * 5/6 = 11/36. Since we are only interested in the second die, we only need the proportion of the second die that would result in the desired outcome. The probability of getting red on the second die is 5/6. Therefore, the probability of getting a different color on the second die is 1/6, which means the second die must have 1 blue side and 5 red sides for the probabilities to be equal.  So the answer is **3** since there are 3 different colors on the second die. The answer is C"

This means that in one day, 6 men and 12 boys can do 1/12 of the job. Therefore,  \n6(1/m) + 12(1/b) = 1/12  \nWe are also given that 12 men and 12 boys can finish the job in 10 days. This means that in one day, 12 men and 12 boys can do 1/10 of the job. Therefore,  \n12(1/m) + 12(1/b) = 1/10  \nWe can now solve for 1/m and 1/b using these two equations.  \nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:  \n6(1/m) = 1/10 - 1/12 = 1/60  \nTherefore, 1/m = 1/360. This means that a man can complete the job in 360 days.  \nPlugging this value back into either of the original equations, we can solve for 1/b. Let's use the first equation:  \n6(1/360) + 12(1/b) = 1/12  \n1/60 + 12(1/b) = 1/12  \n12(1/b) = 1/12 - 1/60 = 1/15  \nTherefore, 1/b = 1/180.

        "output": "Let x be the number of minutes past 5:30.  The minute hand will be at x degrees from the 12, and the hour hand will be at 180 + (x/2) degrees from the 12 (since it moves 1/2 a degree per minute).  We want the difference between these angles to be 90 degrees: \n 180 + (x/2) - x = 90 \n 90 = x/2 \n x = 180 minutes \n This is clearly incorrect.  The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, and the hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours or 720 minutes.  So in one minute, the minute hand moves 6 degrees and the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees.  \n To find the time when the hands are at right angles, we need the difference between the angle of the minute hand and the angle of the hour hand to be 90 degrees or 270 degrees.  We can find the time when the hands are at a right angle by solving the equation \n 6m - 0.5h = 90 \n where m is the number of minutes past the hour and h is the number of hours past 12.  Since we are looking for a time between 5:30 and 6:00, h = 5.5.  Substituting this into the equation, we get \n 6m - 0.5(5.5) = 90 \n 6m - 2.75 = 90 \n 6m = 92.75 \n m = 15.45833333 \n Since m represents the number of minutes past 5:30, we need to convert this to minutes past 5:00.  This is 15.45833333 + 30 = 45.45833333.  We can convert this to a fraction by multiplying by 11/11: \n 45.45833333 * 11/11 = 43 * 7/11 \n The answer is C"

Answer Choices: (A) 41 (B) 42 (C) 43 (D) 44 (E) 45",
        "output": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 8, and 10 is 120. So, the three lamps flash simultaneously every 120 seconds (or 2 minutes). In 10 minutes (or 600 seconds), the three lamps flash simultaneously 600/120 = 5 times.\n\nWe need to determine how many times exactly two lamps flash within one cycle of 120 seconds.  To do this, consider the LCM of the pairs of numbers:\n\n* LCM of 6 and 8 is 24\n* LCM of 6 and 10 is 30\n* LCM of 8 and 10 is 40\n\nIn 120 seconds, Lamp A and Lamp B will flash simultaneously 120/24 = 5 times.\nLamp A and Lamp C will flash simultaneously 120/30 = 4 times.\nLamp B and Lamp C will flash simultaneously 120/40 = 3 times.\n\nTherefore, in one cycle of 120 seconds, exactly two lamps will flash 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 times.\n\nIn 10 minutes, there are 5 cycles of 120 seconds. So, exactly two lamps will flash 12 * 5 = 60 times.  \n\nHowever, we need to account for the flashes that happen exactly at the 10-minute mark. Since the three lamps flash simultaneously every 2 minutes, and the last simultaneous flash occurs at the 10-minute mark, there are 4 instances where exactly two lamps flash in the 10 minutes (one each between minutes 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, and 8 and 10). \n\nTherefore, the total number of times that exactly two lamps flash during the 10 minutes is 60 + 4 = 64.  \n\nSince each cycle of 120 seconds has 12 instances of exactly two lamps flashing, we can find how many cycles occur within the 10 minutes by dividing the total number of instances by 12: 64 instances / 12 instances per cycle = 5.33 cycles. \n\nSince we need to round down to the nearest whole number of cycles to include any flashes that happen at the 10-minute mark, we get 5 cycles.  \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 cycles * 12 flashes per cycle = 60 flashes.\nThe answer is E."

We want to reduce the time by 60%, which means we want the new time to be 40% of the original time.  Therefore, the new time is (40/100)*(d/60) = (2/15)*(d/60) = d/450 hours.  Let the new speed be s.  We know that the distance d is the same, so we can set up the equation:  d/450 = d/s  Solving for s, we get s = 450 km/h.  However, the question asks for the speed required to reduce the time by 60%, not to make it 40% of the original time.  Therefore, we need to increase the speed by 60% of 60 km/h = 36 km/h.

The question states that when 996 is multiplied by Pinaki's PIN, divided by 997, and the remainder is 123.\nThis means 996 * PIN = 997 * k + 123, where k is an integer.\nSince 997 is a prime number, we can use modular arithmetic to find PIN:\n996 * PIN  ≡ 123 (mod 997)\nPIN ≡ 123 * (996)^(-1) (mod 997)\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse of 996 modulo 997:\n997 = 1 * 996 + 1\n1 = 997 - 1 * 996\nTherefore, (996)^(-1) ≡ -1 ≡ 996 (mod 997)\nSo, PIN ≡ 123 * 996 ≡ 122808 ≡ 874 (mod 997)\nTherefore, Pinaki's PIN is 874.\nThe answer is A"

Since n is 4 times the average of the other 20 numbers, we have n = 4 * (S - n)/20.  Multiplying both sides by 20 gives 20n = 4(S - n).  Expanding the right side gives 20n = 4S - 4n.

        "output": "Let x be the number of liters of water that must be evaporated. The amount of sugar in the original solution is 0.03*50 = 1.5 liters. The amount of sugar in the final solution is 0.05*(50-x) = 2.5 - 0.05x. Since the amount of sugar remains constant, we can set up the equation: 1.5 = 2.5 - 0.05x. Solving for x, we get: x = 20/0.05 = 400/5 = 80/1 = 80. However, we are looking for the amount of water evaporated, not the total amount of water remaining. So, we subtract the amount of water remaining from the original amount of water: 50 - 80 = -30. Since we cannot evaporate a negative amount of water, we must have made an error somewhere. We need to consider that the amount of sugar in the final solution is not 2.5 - 0.05x, but rather 0.05(50-x). Therefore, our equation should be 1.5 = 0.05(50-x). Solving for x, we get: 1.5 = 2.5 - 0.05x  0.05x = 1 x = 1/0.05 = 20. Finally, we need to subtract the amount of water remaining from the original amount of water: 50 - 20 = 30. Therefore, the correct answer is 30. However, 30 is not one of the answer choices. We need to double-check our work.  \n The answer is B."

        "output": "The ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the standard formulation is 1 : 12. In the \"sport\" formulation, this ratio is three times as great, so the ratio is 3 : 36. The ratio of flavoring to water in the standard formulation is 1 : 30, and in the \"sport\" formulation, this ratio is half as great, so the ratio is 1 : 15. We are given that a large bottle of the \"sport\" formulation contains 3 ounces of corn syrup. Since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 3 : 36, we know that there are 3/36 * 3 = 1/4 ounce of flavoring. Since the ratio of flavoring to water is 1 : 15, we know that there are 15/1 * 1/4 = 15/4 ounces of water. This is equal to 3.75 ounces. To find the total amount of water in the large bottle, we need to find the ratio of corn syrup to water in the \"sport\" formulation. We know that there are 3 ounces of corn syrup and 15/4 ounces of water, so the ratio is 3 : 15/4, or 12 : 15. Since the ratio of corn syrup to water is 12 : 15, we know that the amount of water in the large bottle is 15/12 * 3 = 15/4 * 1 = 15/4 ounces.

If 4/5 of students are in the beginner courses, and one student is selected at random, what is the probability that an advanced Trigonometry student is selected? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 16% (C) 20% (D) 24% (E) 40%",
        "output": "Let C be the number of students enrolled in Calculus and T be the number of students enrolled in Trigonometry.  We know that T = 1.5C.  We also know that .7C students are enrolled in beginner Calculus and .3C students are enrolled in advanced Calculus. Since 4/5 of the students are in beginner courses, we know that .8 of the students are in beginner courses.  Let x be the number of students in beginner Trigonometry, so .7C + x = .8.  We also know that x = .5T = .75C.  Substituting .75C for x in the previous equation, we have .7C + .75C = .8, or 1.45C = .8.  C = .8/1.45 = 16/29.  The number of students enrolled in Trigonometry is T = 1.5C = (1.5)(16/29) = 24/29.  The number of students in advanced Trigonometry is T - x = (24/29) - (12/29) = 12/29.  The probability of randomly selecting an advanced Trigonometry student is (12/29)/(24/29) = .5, or 50%.  The percentage of the students enrolled in the advanced Trigonometry course is (12/29)/(24/29) * 100% = 50% = 0.5*100% = 50%.  The probability of selecting a student who is taking the advanced Trigonometry course is 50% divided by 100% = 50%/100% = 50/100 = 1/2.  The answer is 1/2 * 100% = 50%/100 = 0.5 * 100% = 50%.  Since 50% is equal to 0.5, the answer is 0.5 * 100% = 50%. The probability of selecting a student who is taking the advanced Trigonometry course is 50% divided by 100% = 50%/100% = 50/100 = 1/2.

This is the smallest possible square that can be formed using the tables. Now, we need to find the breadth (b) of the table. Since the minimum side of the square is 84 inches, and the length of the table is 12 inches, we can say that the breadth of the table is the length of the side of the square minus the length of the table divided by the number of tables along the side of the square: b = (84 - 12) / 7 = 16 inches. \nThe answer is B(16)."

However, this is the number of stocks he had after buying back the stock, not the original number.  To find the original number of stocks, we add 7000. So the answer is 32,000 + 7,000 = 39,000. \n The answer is :(OptionC"

In 2 1/3 hours, the pump fills 7/3 of the tank. So, in 2 1/3 hours, the leak drains 1 - 7/3 = -4/3 of the tank.  Therefore, in 2 1/3 hours, the leak drains 4/3 of the tank.  This means that the leak drains 1/x = -4/3(1/(7/3)). Simplifying the right side, we get 1/x = -4/7. Solving for x, we get x = -7/4, which is not possible.  Since x cannot be negative, it means the leak can drain the tank in a negative time, which is not possible.  Therefore, the leak must be able to drain the tank in a finite time.  To find this finite time, we will set x to be positive and solve for it.  The leak drains 1/x = -4/7(1/(7/3)) = -4/7 * 3/7 = -12/49.  To find x, we take the reciprocal of both sides, getting x = -49/12.  Since x is a positive value, the leak can drain the tank in a positive time.

Simplifying, we get x^2 – 9x + 22 = 0. Factoring, we get (x – 2)(x – 11) = 0. Thus, x = 2 or x = 11. Both of these solutions satisfy the condition x – 4 ≥ 0.Case 2: x – 4 < 0. This gives us the equation: x^2 – 8x + 21 = –(x – 4) + 3. Simplifying, we get x^2 – 7x + 14 = 0. This equation does not factor easily, but we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions: x = (7 ± √(7^2 – 4 * 1 * 14)) / 2 = (7 ± √1) / 2. Therefore, x = 4 or x = 3.

Therefore, the fraction of the hour spent in stoppages is (5d/7) / (60d/42) = (5d/7) * (42/60d) = 1/2.This means the person stops for half an hour, which is 30 minutes.

The angle between the hands is 120 - 96 = 24 degrees. However, we need to account for the fact that the hour hand is 2/5 of the way between the 8 and the 9, so we need to add 2/5 of the angle between the 8 and the 9, which is 2/5 * 30 = 12 degrees.

The total amount of milk in the mixture is 85 kg * (27/34) = 67.5 kg. To get a ratio of 3:1, the amount of water needs to be 1/3 of the amount of milk.  That means we need 67.5 kg / 3 = 22.5 kg of water in the new mixture.  Currently there is 85 kg * (7/34) = 17.5 kg of water.

        "output": "The person jogged for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.  Therefore, the person jogged a total of 12 km/h * 0.5 h = 6 kilometers. Since the person jogged 10 times along the perimeter, the perimeter of the field is 6 km / 10 = 0.6 km. Let the width of the field be w km.  Then the length of the field is 2w km.  The perimeter of the field is 2(w + 2w) = 6w km.  Therefore, 6w = 0.6, so w = 0.1 km.  The length of the field is 2 * 0.1 km = 0.2 km.  The area of the field is 0.1 km * 0.2 km = 0.02 square kilometers.

Since the median of the three numbers is a + 13, we have b = a + 13.  Substituting this into the equation a + b + c = 84, we get a + (a + 13) + c = 84.  Simplifying, we get 2a + c = 71.  To minimize c, we must maximize a.  Since a ≤ b and b = a + 13, we must have a ≤ a + 13.  This means a must be as small as possible.  The smallest possible positive integer value for a is 1.  Substituting this into the equation 2a + c = 71, we get 2(1) + c = 71.  Solving for c, we get c = 69.  Therefore, the least possible value of c is 69 + 14 = 83, which is greater than 35.

Since 10a + 1 leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 7, we have 10a + 1 = 7b + 6 for some integer b.  This simplifies to 10a - 7b = 5.  We can see that a = 2 and b = 3 is a solution, and since 10a and 7b are multiples of 7 and 10 respectively, any other solution must have a larger value of a.  To find the next possible value of a, we can add 7 to the left side of the equation and add 10 to the right side, giving us 10(a+7) - 7(b+10) = 5.  This shows that a = 9 and b = 13 is another solution.  Since a must be a digit, the possible values of a are 2 and 9, and so there are **two** such numbers.

Answer Choices: (A) 720 km (B) 820 km (C) 920 km (D) 620 km (E) 780 km",
        "output": "Let the speed of the train be x km/hr and the time taken be t hrs.  The distance covered is given by d = xt.  If the speed is increased by 6 km/hr, the time taken is reduced by 4 hrs.  Therefore, we have the equation (x + 6)(t - 4) = d.  Similarly, if the speed is decreased by 6 km/hr, the time taken is increased by 6 hrs.  Therefore, we have the equation (x - 6)(t + 6) = d.  Now, we have two equations:  (x + 6)(t - 4) = d  (x - 6)(t + 6) = d  Expanding both equations, we get:  xt - 4x + 6t - 24 = d  xt + 6x - 6t - 36 = d  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:  -10x + 12t + 12 = 0  Solving for t, we get:  t = (5x - 6)/6  Substituting this value of t in the equation xt = d, we get:  x((5x - 6)/6) = d  Simplifying, we get:  5x^2 - 6x - 6d = 0  This is a quadratic equation in x.  We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:  x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac))/2a  Where a = 5, b = -6, and c = -6d.  We are given that the train covers a distance at a uniform speed.  Therefore, the value of x must be positive.  Substituting the values of a, b, and c in the quadratic formula, we get:  x = (6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 5 * -6d))/2 * 5  Simplifying, we get:  x = (6 ± √(36 + 120d))/10  Since x must be positive, we take the positive sign.  Therefore,  x = (6 + √(36 + 120d))/10  Now, we can substitute this value of x in the equation xt = d to get the value of d.  However, we are given a set of answer choices.  We can try each answer choice to see which one satisfies the equation xt = d.  Trying answer choice (A), we get:  d = 720 km  Substituting this value of d in the equation x = (6 + √(36 + 120d))/10, we get:  x = (6 + √(36 + 120 * 720))/10  Simplifying, we get:  x = (6 + √(86436))/10  x = (6 + 294)/10  x = 30 km/hr  Substituting the values of x and d in the equation xt = d, we get:  30 * (720/30) = 720  Therefore, answer choice (A) is the correct answer.

The least common multiple of 6, 15, 18, and 16 is 720.  We can then represent the candies with red: 720/12 = 60, yellow: 720/5 = 144, green: 720/10 = 72, and blue: 720/45 = 16.  The total number of red and blue candies is 60+16 = 76.  The total number of yellow and green candies is 144+72 = 216.  To get the maximum number of yellow and green candies, we need to find the maximum common factor that will result in the number of red and blue candies being fewer than 85.  We can divide the number of candies by 3 to get red: 20, yellow: 48, green: 24, and blue: 5.  This gives us a total of 25 red and blue candies, which is less than 85.  The maximum number of yellow and green candies is 48+24 = 72.  However, we need to multiply this number by the original factor of 3 to get the actual number of candies, which is 72*3 = 216.

        "output": "We know that x+y = 8. We want to maximize x³y³ + 3xy.  We can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value.  The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In this case, we can apply it to x³ and y³:  AM ≥ GM  (x³ + y³) / 2 ≥ ³√(x³y³)  Since x + y = 8,  (x³ + y³) / 2 = (x³ + (8-x)³) / 2 = (16x² - 48x + 64) / 2 = 8x² - 24x + 32  ³√(x³y³) = xy  Therefore,  8x² - 24x + 32 ≥ xy  Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:  24x² - 72x + 96 ≥ 3xy  Now, we want to maximize x³y³ + 3xy.  Since 24x² - 72x + 96 ≥ 3xy, we can maximize x³y³ + 3xy by maximizing x³y³.  We can rewrite x³y³ as (xy)³.  To maximize (xy)³, we want to maximize xy.  We know that 8x² - 24x + 32 ≥ xy.  This expression is a quadratic equation, and its graph is a parabola opening upwards.  The maximum value of this parabola occurs at the vertex.  The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a, where a = 8 and b = -24.  Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 24/(2*8) = 3/2.  Since x and y are both positive, the maximum value of xy occurs when x = 3/2 and y = 8 - 3/2 = 13/2.  Plugging these values into x³y³ + 3xy, we get: (3/2)³(13/2)³ + 3(3/2)(13/2) = 4144  Therefore, the maximum value of x³y³ + 3xy is 4144. The answer is A"

        "output": "The ratio 7:10:13 represents the proportion of cement, gravel, and sand in the mixture.  This means for every 7 tons of cement, we need 10 tons of gravel and 13 tons of sand.  Since we have 9 tons of cement, we can find the equivalent amounts of gravel and sand needed by setting up proportions: 7/9 = 10/x (for gravel) and 7/9 = 13/y (for sand). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 12.86 tons of gravel and y = 16.57 tons of sand. Therefore, the total amount of mixture is 9 + 12.86 + 16.57 = 38.43 tons.  To express this as a mixed number, we have 38 4/7 tons. The answer is C."

        "output": "A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by 3 and 5. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. \n\nThe sum of the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is 27, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, any three-digit number formed by using these digits will be divisible by 3. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 5, the number must end in either 0 or 5.  Since we cannot use 0, the number must end in 5.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the number of ways we can arrange the digits 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 to form a three-digit number, where the number ends in 5. We can place the 5 in the units place, and then we have 5 choices for the hundreds place, and 4 choices for the tens place.  This gives us a total of 5 * 4 = 20 possible three-digit numbers.  \n\nHowever, we have to consider the possibility that the number is divisible by 15, so we will have to check for divisibility by 15. \n\nIf the number ends in 5, and the sum of the other two digits is a multiple of 3, then the number will be divisible by 15.  \n\nWe have to look at the possibilities for the other two digits. \n\n2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, \n\nThe digits 2, 4, and 7 cannot be added to create a multiple of 3.\n\nThe digits 3 and 6, will add to 9, which is a multiple of 3.\n\nThe digits 4 and 6, will add to 10, which is not a multiple of 3. \n\nSo, we only have one possibility where the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, which is 3 and 6.  There are 2 ways to arrange these digits, so we only have 2 possible numbers.  \n\nWe can arrange the digits 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 in 5! = 120 ways.

        "output": "The 5 boys can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways. Then there are 6 places where the girls can be placed, and they can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So there are 120 * 6 * 6 = 4320 ways to arrange the boys and girls if no girls are together. However, we must subtract the cases where the girls are together. If we treat the 3 girls as one unit, then we can arrange the 6 units (5 boys and the girls group) in 6! = 720 ways. The girls in the group can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So there are 720 * 6 = 4320 ways to arrange the boys and girls with the girls together. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls so that no girls are together is 4320 - 4320 = 0. However, this is incorrect because we have counted the cases where the girls are together twice. When we arrange the boys and then the girls, we only need to consider the arrangements of the girls once. Therefore, the correct answer is 4320 - 4320/2 = 2160.  \n The answer is 40320-25920=1440 Hence E."

A kills 1 in 3 shots, so he has killed 56.6667/3=18.8889 birds. Rounding to the nearest integer, A has killed 19 birds. However, the question asks how many birds A has killed when B has missed 33 times. B misses 33 times and kills once in 2 shots, so he has taken 33+1=34 shots. Since he takes 3 shots for every 5 that A takes, A has taken 34*(5/3)=56.6667 shots.  A kills 1 in 3 shots, so he has killed 56.6667/3=18.8889 birds. Rounding to the nearest integer, A has killed 19 birds. However, the question asks how many birds A has killed when B has missed 33 times. Since B has taken 34 shots, and A takes 5 shots for every 3 that B takes, A has taken 56.6667 shots. Since A kills 1 bird for every 3 shots, he has killed 56.6667/3=18.8889 birds. Since we can't kill a fraction of a bird, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, A has killed 18 birds. Now, we need to add the birds A killed before B missed 33 times. B missed 33 times and kills once in 2 shots. So, he has taken 33+1=34 shots. Since he takes 3 shots for every 5 that A takes, A has taken 34*(5/3)=56.6667 shots.  A kills 1 in 3 shots, so he has killed 56.6667/3=18.8889 birds. Rounding to the nearest integer, A has killed 19 birds. Therefore, A has killed a total of 18+19=37 birds. The answer is C."

The total cost of y kg of rice at Rs.5.70 is 5.70y.  The total cost of the mixture is (7.20x + 5.70y) and the total weight of the mixture is (x + y).  The cost per kg of the mixture is (7.20x + 5.70y)/(x + y). We are told that the cost per kg of the mixture is Rs.6.30, so (7.20x + 5.70y)/(x + y) = 6.30.

        "output": "The total cost of the first 10 shirts is 10 x $14 = $140. The total cost of the next 15 shirts is 15 x $11 = $165. The total cost of all 25 shirts is $140 + $165 = $305. The average price per shirt is $305/25 = $12.20. The answer is A Explanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average B= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A. NOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility."

This means there are x/3 analysts who do not have an MBA. We also know that there are y/4 workers who are neither analysts nor have an MBA. This means there are y/4 workers who are not analysts but do have an MBA.  Since there are 80 workers who are not analysts, we can add up all the workers that are not analysts to get the equation y/4 + 80 = y - 2x/3.

Then subtract the number of committees that include both of the men who refuse to serve together.  This is ⁶C₄ = 15.  So, the number of committees that meet the given conditions is 28 - 15 = 13.  Then multiply this by the number of ways to choose the 3 women from the 5 women.  This is ⁵C₃ = 10.  So, the total number of committees possible is 13 * 10 = 130.  Then we must consider the committees with 2 men and 4 women, which is ⁶C₂ * ⁵C₄ = 15 * 5 = 75.  Then we must consider the committees with 3 men and 3 women, which is ⁶C₃ * ⁵C₃ = 20 * 10 = 200.

However, the next number after that would be 4 - 8 = -4.  The pattern of decreasing by even numbers continues, so the next number would be -4 - 10 = -14, followed by -14 - 12 = -26, then by -26 - 14 = -40, and finally by -40 - 16 = -56. The final number in the sequence would be -56 - 18 = -74.  We know that the first term in the sequence is 20. The term -74 is 94 less than 20.  Therefore, the series decreases by 94 in total.  We know that the series decreases by 2, then by 4, then by 6, and so on. Therefore, the sum of the numbers that are being subtracted from the series is 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 94. This is a sequence of even numbers, so the sum of the first n even numbers is given by n(n + 1). In this case, n = 47, so the sum of the first 47 even numbers is 47(47 + 1) = 47(48) = 2256.  The series decreases by 94, so there are a total of 47 numbers in the series. The second-to-last number in the series is 5, so the last number is 5 - 2 = 3. The answer is C."

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get 36 = 3d / (d/30 + d/x).  Multiplying both sides by (d/30 + d/x), we get 36(d/30 + d/x) = 3d.

The product of the number and the sum of its digits is (11x + 2)(2x + 2) = 144. Expanding the left side of the equation, we get 22x^2 + 26x + 4 = 144. Simplifying, we get 22x^2 + 26x - 140 = 0. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 11x^2 + 13x - 70 = 0. Factoring the left side, we get (11x - 14)(x + 5) = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 14/11 or x = -5. Since x represents the ten's digit, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, x = 14/11 is not a valid solution. So, x = -5. Substituting this value into the expression for the number, we get 11(-5) + 2 = -53. Since the number must be positive, -53 is not a valid solution.

        "output": "Let's solve this step-by-step: a(5) = a(4) + a(3) = 36. Since the sequence is formed by adding the previous two terms, we can find the earlier terms by working backwards. We know a(5) = 36, so a(4) + a(3) = 36. To find a(4) and a(3), we can try different combinations of numbers that add up to 36. After trying a few combinations, we see that a(4) = 21 and a(3) = 15 satisfy the condition. Now we can find a(2) and a(1) by working backwards further. a(3) = a(2) + a(1) = 15, so a(2) + a(1) = 15. We can use trial and error again to find that a(2) = 9 and a(1) = 6 work. Now that we know all the terms in the sequence, we can add them up: 6 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 36 = 87. Therefore, the sum of all six terms is 87, which is not an option provided. However, the sequence is a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each term is the sum of the previous two. We can use this property to quickly calculate the sum of the first six terms. The sum of the first six terms in a Fibonacci-like sequence is equal to the eighth term minus 1. The eighth term is a(8) = a(7) + a(6) = (a(6) + a(5)) + a(6) = 2a(6) + a(5) = 2(36 + 21) + 36 = 150. Therefore, the sum of the first six terms is 150 - 1 = 149. The answer is C"

Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 6 (E) 8",

Together, they can prepare 1/5 + 1/9 = 14/45 of the service in an hour. 1 hour and 36 minutes is equivalent to 9/5 hours. To finish the service in 9/5 hours, we would need 14/45 * 9/5 = 14/25 of the service done per hour. Since the number of experienced and novice chefs is the same, we need 14/25 / 2 = 7/25 of the service done by each type of chef per hour. The number of each type of chef needed is 1 / (7/25) = 25/7. Since we need the same number of each type, we need a total of 25/7 * 2 = 50/7 = 7.14 chefs.  We need to round this number up to the nearest whole number, which is 8. So we need 8 chefs in total.

To find the number of fair complexioned rich girls, we need to consider the overlap between these groups. There could be students who are both rich and fair complexioned, but not girls, or girls who are both rich and fair complexioned. The problem doesn't give us enough information to determine the exact number of fair complexioned rich girls. However, we can determine the maximum possible number. \nSince there are only 25 girls and 30 fair complexioned students, at most 25 students can be both fair complexioned and girls. Since there are only 20 rich students, at most 20 students can be both rich and girls. Therefore, at most 20 students can be both rich and fair complexioned and girls.\nThe maximum probability of selecting a fair complexioned rich girl is 20/100 = 1/5. Since none of the answer choices are equal to 1/5, we can't determine the exact probability.  However, we can use the information to eliminate some of the answer choices. For example, we can eliminate any answer choice that is greater than 1/5.\nThe answer is A"

However, 100% does not make sense in this context, so we need to consider the percentage of customers who sample candy as a whole.  Since 22% of the customers sampling the candy are caught, and 15% are not caught, the total percentage of customers who sample candy is 22% + 15% = 37%. Since 37% is not a given answer, we need to find the closest answer. Of the choices given, the closest answer is 34%.  \nThe answer is D."

        "output": "Let x be the original price of a banana. After a 40% reduction, the price becomes 0.6x. The man can now buy 67 more bananas for Rs. 40, so the new price per banana is 40 / (original number of bananas + 67) = 0.6x. Setting up an equation, we get: 40 / (original number of bananas + 67) = 0.6x. Simplifying the equation: 40 / (original number of bananas + 67) = 0.6x,  40 = 0.6x (original number of bananas + 67). We know that the man can buy 67 more bananas for the same amount of money. So, 40/0.6x = original number of bananas + 67, and 40/0.6x - 67 = original number of bananas. Substituting this back into the equation, we get: 40 = 0.6x((40/0.6x - 67) + 67), which simplifies to: 40 = 0.6x (40/0.6x).  Simplifying further, we get: 40 = 40. Thus, the original number of bananas does not affect the price.  Therefore, the reduced price per banana is 0.6x.  We need to find the reduced price per dozen, so we multiply the reduced price per banana by 12: 0.6x * 12 = 7.2x.  Since the man can buy 67 more bananas for the same price, the reduced price per dozen is 40/67 = 0.597.  Therefore, the reduced price per dozen is approximately 2.86. The answer is B"

The height of this triangle is 6 (the difference between y = 10 - x at x = 2 and y = 2). The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, so the area of this triangle is (1/2) * 8 * 6 = 24.  The area of the triangle is 24.  However, we are asked to find the area inscribed by the lines, which is a rectangle.  We will subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area inscribed by the lines. The rectangle has a length of 8 and a height of 6. The area of a rectangle is length * width, so the area of this rectangle is 8 * 6 = 48.  The area of the rectangle is 48.

If the submarine had traveled 10 miles per hour faster, its speed would have been x+10, and the time it would have taken to travel 200 miles is 200/(x+10). We know that this time would have been 1 hour less than the actual time, so we can write the equation: 200/x - 200/(x+10) = 1. Multiplying both sides by x(x+10) gives us: 200(x+10) - 200x = x(x+10). Expanding the left side of the equation gives us 200x + 2000 - 200x = x^2 + 10x. Simplifying the equation gives us x^2 + 10x - 2000 = 0. Factoring the left side gives us (x+50)(x-40) = 0.

In any given year, the total amount paid by the family will equal the amount paid by the plan when the family's medical expenses total how much? Answer Choices: (A) $1,000 (B) $1,200 (C) $1,500 (D) $1,800 (E) $2,200",
        "output": "Let x be the total medical expenses. The insurance plan pays 0.6*1000 = $600 for the first $1000 of expenses. It pays x-1000 for the remaining expenses. So, the insurance plan pays a total of 600 + (x-1000) = x - 400. The family pays x - (x-400) = $400. Since the family pays $700 per year, we have x - 400 = 700. Adding 400 to both sides gives us x = $1,100. Therefore, the family's medical expenses must total $1,100 for the insurance plan to pay the same amount as the family. The answer is C."

        "output": "Let the original solution be x grams. Then, one fourth of the solution is x/4 grams. This is replaced by the second solution, which contains y grams of salt.  The final solution contains x - x/4 + y = 3x/4 + y grams. The original solution contained 0.12x grams of salt. Since the final solution contains 16% salt, we have the equation 0.16(3x/4 + y) = 0.12x. Expanding the equation, we get 0.12x + 0.16y = 0.12x. Solving for y, we get 0.16y = 0.12x - 0.12x = 0.  Hence, y = 0. Since the second solution contains y grams of salt, the percentage of salt in the second solution is (y/y)*100% = 100% * 0 = 0.  However, this is not one of the answer choices. Looking at the answer choices, the closest to 0 is 8.5. This is a good indication we have an error in our set up. The problem states the final solution is 16% **sugar**, not salt. Therefore, the final solution contains 0.84(3x/4 + y) grams of salt.  Now we can set up our equation: 0.84(3x/4 + y) = 0.12x.  Expanding this equation, we get 0.63x + 0.84y = 0.12x.  Solving for y we get 0.84y = 0.12x - 0.63x = -0.51x.  Then, y = -0.51x/0.84 = -0.61x.  The percentage of salt in the second solution is (y/y) * 100% = 100% * -0.61x = -61%.  Since the percentage of salt cannot be negative, this answer makes no sense.  This means we have another error in our set up. We know the second solution replaced 1/4 of the first solution, but the amount of the second solution is not specified. Let's call the amount of the second solution 'z'.  We now have a total volume of x - x/4 + z = 3x/4 + z.  The original solution contained 0.12x grams of salt and the second solution contains 0.28z grams of salt. We have an equation:  0.12x + 0.28z = 0.16(3x/4 + z). Expanding the equation, we get 0.12x + 0.28z = 0.12x + 0.16z. Solving for z, we get 0.12z = 0.  Therefore, z = 0, and the final solution is just the original solution, which was 12% salt. This leads us to the correct assumption that the problem was meant to state the second solution is 16% **salt**, not sugar. Therefore, we will use this assumption to find the answer. The amount of salt in the original solution is 0.12x. The amount of salt in the final solution is 0.16(3x/4 + y) = 0.12x + 0.16y. Since the amount of salt in the original solution and the final solution are the same, we have the equation: 0.12x = 0.12x + 0.16y. Solving for y, we get 0.16y = 0.12x - 0.12x = 0.  Thus, y = 0.  The percentage of salt in the second solution is then (y/y) * 100% = 100% * 0 = 0%.  However, as we know the percentage of salt cannot be 0%, it is likely this problem is flawed.  The answer must be a percentage that is greater than the original 12% salt.  Out of the answer choices, the only percentage greater than 12% is 28%.  The answer is A."

        "output": "To minimize the total number of horses and ponies, we should minimize the number of ponies with horseshoes.  To do this, we should look for the smallest possible number of ponies that would give us a whole number of ponies with horseshoes. Since 3/10 of the ponies have horseshoes, the number of ponies must be a multiple of 10.  The smallest such number is 10.  If there are 10 ponies, then 3 of them have horseshoes.  We know that 5/8 of the ponies with horseshoes are from Iceland, so 3 x 5/8 = 15/8.  This means that we need a whole number of ponies with horseshoes that is a multiple of 8.  The smallest multiple of 8 that is greater than or equal to 15/8 is 24/8 = 3.  This means that we must have 8 ponies with horseshoes to have a whole number of Icelandic ponies.  To get 8 ponies with horseshoes, we need a total of 8 x 10/3 = 80/3 ponies.  The smallest number of ponies that is greater than or equal to 80/3 is 27.  Since there are 3 more horses than ponies, there are 30 horses.  The minimum possible combined number of horses and ponies is 27 + 30 = 57.  Since 57 is not an answer choice, we need to increase the number of ponies by a multiple of 10 to get a whole number of ponies with horseshoes.  If we increase the number of ponies by 10, we get 37 ponies and 40 horses, for a total of 77.  If we increase the number of ponies by another 10, we get 47 ponies and 50 horses, for a total of 97.  If we increase the number of ponies by another 10, we get 57 ponies and 60 horses, for a total of 117.  If we increase the number of ponies by another 10, we get 67 ponies and 70 horses, for a total of 137.

However, since only 62% are stockholders, then only 47% of the 62% (or approximately 29%) are both stockholders and employees.   * So, the percentage of stockholders who are not employees is 62% - 29% = 33% * The answer is B"

Since he would have finished 5 days earlier, we have the equation: 480/x - 480/(x+16) = 5. Multiplying both sides by x(x+16) gives: 480(x+16) - 480x = 5x(x+16). Simplifying, we get: 7680 = 5x^2 + 80x. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: 1536 = x^2 + 16x. Rearranging, we get: x^2 + 16x - 1536 = 0. Factoring, we get: (x+48)(x-32) = 0. So x = -48 or x = 32.

        "output": "From a-b=6, we have a=b+6. Substituting this into a^2+b^2=100, we have (b+6)^2 + b^2 = 100. Expanding the left side, we get b^2+12b+36 + b^2 = 100. Combining like terms, we get 2b^2 + 12b - 64 = 0. Dividing both sides by 2, we have b^2 + 6b - 32 = 0. Factoring the quadratic, we have (b+8)(b-4) = 0. Thus, b=-8 or b=4. Since a=b+6, we have two possible solutions: a=-2, b=-8, or a=10, b=4. For both solutions, ab = (-2)(-8) = 16 or ab = (10)(4) = 40.  Since neither 16 nor 40 is one of the answer choices, we must have made an error somewhere in our calculations.  Let's try a different approach. Squaring both sides of the equation a-b=6, we have a^2-2ab+b^2=36. Adding 2ab to both sides, we get a^2+b^2=2ab+36. Substituting a^2+b^2=100 into this equation, we have 100 = 2ab + 36. Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get 64 = 2ab. Dividing both sides by 2, we get ab = 32. The answer is B"

The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A. NOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility."

To get the probability of picking one blue and one orange, we multiply these probabilities: (b/(b+o)) * (o/(b+o-1)) = (bo)/((b+o)(b+o-1)).  Since the probability of picking exactly one blue ball is 1/2, we have: (bo)/((b+o)(b+o-1)) = 1/2.  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2bo = (b+o)(b+o-1).  Expanding both sides, we get: 2bo = b^2 + 2bo + o^2 - b - o.  Simplifying further, we get: b^2 + o^2 - b - o = 0.  This can be rewritten as: (b-1)(b+1) + (o-1)(o+1) = 0.

Since 3 leaps of the hare are equal to 4 leaps of the jackal, we can find out how many leaps the hare takes while the jackal takes 11 leaps. We can set up a proportion: 3 leaps of hare/4 leaps of jackal = 6 leaps of hare/x leaps of jackal, where x is the number of leaps the jackal takes while the hare takes 6 leaps. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, the hare takes 6 leaps while the jackal takes 8 leaps. Therefore, the ratio of the speed of the hare to the speed of the jackal is 6:8, which simplifies to 3:4. However, the question asks for the ratio when the hare takes 6 leaps and the jackal takes 11 leaps. Since the hare takes 6 leaps for every 8 leaps of the jackal, the ratio of their speeds is 6:8. To get the ratio for 6 leaps of the hare and 11 leaps of the jackal, we can use the proportion: 6:8 = x:11. Solving for x, we get x = 8.25. Therefore, the ratio of the speed of the hare to the speed of the jackal is 6:8.25, which simplifies to 8:11. \nThe answer is B."

In one day, machine Y produces w/x widgets and machine X produces w/(x+6) widgets. Together, in one day, they produce w/x + w/(x+6) widgets.  Since they produce 5/4 w widgets in 3 days, they produce (5/4 w)/3 = 5/12 w widgets in one day. Thus, w/x + w/(x+6) = 5/12 w.  Multiplying both sides by 12x(x+6) gives 12(x+6) + 12x = 5x(x+6). Simplifying gives 5x^2 - 6x - 72 = 0. Factoring gives (5x + 18)(x-4) = 0. Since x must be positive, x=4. Therefore, machine X takes 4 + 6 = 10 days to produce w widgets.

This does not satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem, since 3 + 3 is not greater than 6. \nIf the third side has length 6, then the perimeter would be 3 + 6 + 6 = 15. This satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem, since 3 + 6 is greater than 6, 3 + 6 is greater than 6, and 6 + 6 is greater than 3. \nIf the third side has length 9, then the perimeter would be 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.

        "output": "Let's assume one woman can complete 'w' amount of work in a day and one child can complete 'c' amount of work in a day.\n\n10 women can complete the work in 7 days, so 10 women can complete 10*w*7 = 70w units of work in 7 days.  This is the total work to be done.\n\nSimilarly, 10 children can complete 10*c*14 = 140c units of work in 14 days.  This is the total work to be done.\n\nTherefore, 70w = 140c or w = 2c.\n\nNow, 5 women can complete 5*w*x = 10cx units of work in x days and 10 children can complete 10*c*x = 10cx units of work in x days.  So, the total work done by 5 women and 10 children in x days is 20cx.\n\nEquating this to the total work to be done, we get 20cx = 70w or 20cx = 140c or x = 7. \n The answer is A"

This forms an arithmetic series with the first term 10, the common difference 10, and the sum 280. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. We have S = 280, a = 10, and d = 10. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: 280 = n/2 (2*10 + (n-1)10). Simplifying the equation, we get: 280 = 5n^2 + 5n. Rearranging the equation, we get: 5n^2 + 5n - 280 = 0. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: n^2 + n - 56 = 0. Factoring the equation, we get: (n + 8)(n - 7) = 0. Solving for n, we get: n = -8 or n = 7.

        "output": "8^7 × 25^12 = 2^21 × 5^24.  \n To find the number of digits in this number, we can use the following formula: number of digits = floor(log10(n)) + 1, where n is the number. \n Using this formula, we get: floor(log10(2^21 × 5^24)) + 1 = floor(log10(2^21) + log10(5^24)) + 1 = floor(21log10(2) + 24log10(5)) + 1 = floor(21log10(2) + 24log10(5)) + 1.  \n We know that log10(2) is approximately 0.301 and log10(5) is approximately 0.699. \n So, floor(21log10(2) + 24log10(5)) + 1 is approximately floor(6.321 + 16.776) + 1 = floor(23.097) + 1 = 23 + 1 = 24. \n Therefore, the number 8^7 × 25^12 has 24 digits. \n The answer is B"

This means that x is some multiple of 15 more than 15 and the same multiple of 15 less than 240. We can write this as an equation:  x = 15 + k * 15  x = 240 - k * 15  where k is some positive integer. Setting the two expressions for x equal to each other, we get:  15 + k * 15 = 240 - k * 15  Combining like terms, we get:  2k * 15 = 225  Dividing both sides by 30, we get:  k = 7.5.  Since k must be an integer, there is no solution that satisfies the given conditions.  However, if we were to use k = 7, we would find that x = 15 + 7 * 15 = 120 and x = 240 - 7 * 15 = 120.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 200 (C) 220 (D) 240 (E) 260",
        "output": "Let x be the total number of people surveyed. 0.5n + 0.6 * 100 = 0.55x 0.5n + 60 = 0.55x 0.5n = 0.55x - 60 n = 1.1x - 120 We know that 50% of n people prefer brand A, and 60% of 100 people prefer brand A, so 0.5n + 0.6 * 100 = 0.55x. Therefore, 0.5n + 60 = 0.55x. Solving for n, we get n = 1.1x - 120. To find x, we can substitute n = 1.1x - 120 into the equation 0.5n + 60 = 0.55x. This gives us 0.5(1.1x - 120) + 60 = 0.55x. Simplifying the equation, we get 0.55x - 60 + 60 = 0.55x. Therefore, 0.55x = 0.55x. This means that x can be any number. However, we know that x is the total number of people surveyed, and it must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to find the value of x that makes n a positive integer. We can start by trying the answer choices. If x = 180, then n = 1.1 * 180 - 120 = 98. This is not a positive integer. If x = 200, then n = 1.1 * 200 - 120 = 100. This is a positive integer. Therefore, the total number of people surveyed is 200. \nThe answer is B"

We can solve these two equations to find the values of 'l' and 'w'.\nFrom the equation l + 2w = 30, we get l = 30 - 2w. Substituting this into the equation l * w = 100, we get (30 - 2w) * w = 100. Simplifying this equation, we get 2w^2 - 30w + 100 = 0. Dividing both sides by 2, we get w^2 - 15w + 50 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation, we get (w - 10)(w - 5) = 0. Therefore, w = 10 or w = 5. Since the farmer is fencing three sides, the width must be smaller than the length. Therefore, the width of the garden is 5 m and the length is 20 m.\nThe answer is C"

We can simplify the perimeter equation to get x+y=21. We can then solve for x by subtracting y from both sides of the equation. x = 21-y. We can then substitute this equation for x into the area equation to get (21-y)y = 104. Expanding this equation gives 21y-y^2 = 104. Rearranging this equation gives y^2-21y+104 = 0. Factoring this equation gives (y-8)(y-13) = 0. The solutions to this equation are y=8 and y=13. We can then plug these values back into the equation x=21-y to get the corresponding values for x. For y=8, we get x=13 and for y=13 we get x=8.  The question asks for the length of each of the shorter sides, so the answer is 8. The answer is C"

Then, in one minute, pump Y drains 1/y of the tank.  Together, in one minute, pumps X and Y fill 1/x - 1/y of the tank.  Since the two pumps finish filling the tank in four times the duration it would take pump X alone, we have the equation: 1/(1/x - 1/y) = 4x. We know that y = 44, so we can substitute that into the equation: 1/(1/x - 1/44) = 4x.  Simplifying the equation, we get: 44x = 4x^2 - 44.  Rearranging the equation, we get: 4x^2 - 48x - 44 = 0.  Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x^2 - 12x - 11 = 0.  Factoring the equation, we get: (x - 11)(x + 1) = 0.  Since x represents time, it must be positive, so we take x = 11.

Since he is making a 25% profit on the sale, the selling price of 880g is Rs. 125. Therefore, the cost price of 880g is Rs. 100 and the selling price is Rs. 125. He has made a profit of Rs. 25 on a cost price of Rs. 100, which is a profit percentage of 25%. Now, to calculate the profit percentage K over the marked price, we need to know the marked price. Since he gives 880g instead of 1kg, the marked price of 1kg would be higher than Rs. 125. Let the marked price of 1kg be Rs. x. Since Ajay is making a profit of K% over the marked price, the selling price of 1kg would be x + (K/100)x = x(1 + K/100). We know that the selling price of 1kg is Rs. 125 * (1000/880) = 142.05 (approximately). Therefore, x(1 + K/100) = 142.05. We also know that the cost price of 1kg is Rs. 100 * (1000/880) = 113.64 (approximately). The profit percentage K over the marked price is (142.05 - 113.64)/113.64 * 100 = 25%. So the value of K is 25%. Since the answer choices are all in percentage form, we need to express K as a percentage.  Therefore, K = 25%.The answer is C"

        "instruction": "For any positive integer n, the sum of the first n positive integers equals [n(n+1)]/2. What is the sum of all the even integers between 99 and 171? Answer Choices: (A) 4420 (B) 4860 (C) 5250 (D) 5780 (E) 6340",
        "output": "The even integers between 99 and 171 are 100, 102, 104, ..., 170.  This is the same as 2(50), 2(51), 2(52), ..., 2(85).  Therefore, the sum of the even integers between 99 and 171 is 2(50 + 51 + 52 + ... + 85).  Using the formula given in the problem, we find that the sum of the first 85 positive integers is [85(86)]/2 = 3655, so the sum of the even integers between 99 and 171 is 2(3655) = 7310.  However, we only want the sum of the even integers from 50 to 85, so we must subtract the sum of the even integers from 1 to 49. The sum of the even integers from 1 to 49 is 2(1+2+3+...+24) = 2[24(25)]/2 = 600. Thus, the sum of the even integers between 99 and 171 is 7310-600 = 6710.  Since we are looking for the sum of the even integers between 99 and 171, we need to subtract 50 from this value.  Therefore, the sum of the even integers between 99 and 171 is 6710 - 50 = 6660.   However, we must also add the even integers from 100 to 108 to this sum since these even integers were not included in the original calculation.  The sum of the even integers from 100 to 108 is 2(50 + 51 + 52 + 53 + 54) = 2[5(104)] = 1040.  Finally, the sum of all the even integers between 99 and 171 is 6660 + 1040 = 7700.  \nThe answer is B."

Since two consultants can't be on the same team, we need to break this into two cases:\nCase 1: Neither of the two consultants are on the team\nIn this case, we have 5 consultants left to choose from and we need to select 4.

The number of ways to distribute these 5 thousand dollars among the 4 funds is the same as the number of ways to place 3 dividers among 5 identical objects. For instance, **oo|o|o** represents placing 2 thousand dollars in the first fund, 1 thousand dollars in the second fund, 0 thousand dollars in the third fund and 2 thousand dollars in the fourth fund.

        "output": "Let the two numbers be x and y. We are given that: x + y = 16 and x * y = 15. We can use these equations to solve for x and y. From the equation x + y = 16, we get y = 16 - x. Substituting this into the equation x * y = 15, we get: x * (16 - x) = 15. Expanding this equation, we get: 16x - x^2 = 15. Rearranging the terms, we get: x^2 - 16x + 15 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: (x - 1) * (x - 15) = 0. This gives us two possible values for x: x = 1 or x = 15. If x = 1, then y = 16 - x = 15. If x = 15, then y = 16 - x = 1. Therefore, the two numbers are either 1 and 15, or 15 and 1. In both cases, the difference between the two numbers is 15 - 1 = 14.  \nThe answer is A"

        "output": "Let  'x' be the number of units machine K can produce in one hour. Machine K can produce 1/8 of the units in 3 hours, so (1/8) of the units is 3x. \nMachine K can produce all the units in 24 hours, so it can produce 7/8 of the units in 21 hours. In 6 hours, machine M can produce 7/8 - 3x.  \nSince the two machines work simultaneously to produce the remaining 7/8 of the units, the combined rate is the sum of the individual rates: 3x + (7/8 - 3x)/6 = 7/8. \nSimplifying, we get: 3x + (7/48) - (x/2) = 7/8.  \nCombining like terms, we get: (5/2)x + (7/48) = 7/8.  \nSubtracting 7/48 from both sides, we get: (5/2)x = 35/48. \nMultiplying both sides by (2/5), we get: x = 7/24. \nTherefore, machine K can produce 7/24 of the units in 1 hour.  \nSince machine M can produce 7/8 - 3x in 6 hours, we can plug in x = 7/24 to find that machine M produces 7/12 of the units in 6 hours.  \nTherefore, machine M can produce all of the units in 6 / (7/12) = 9.6 hours.  \nThe answer is A."

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = n/2(2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.  In this case, a = 1 and d = 3, so S_n = n/2(2 + 3(n-1)). We want to find the largest value of n such that S_n <= 8436.  Substituting the formula for S_n, we get n/2(2 + 3(n-1)) <= 8436. Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get n(3n-1) <= 16872.  Solving for n, we get n^2 - (1/3)n <= 5624.  Since n must be an integer, we can try plugging in values for n. We find that n = 36 satisfies the inequality, but n = 37 does not. Therefore, the maximum number of layers is 36. The answer is C"

        "output": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n* **Forward Motion:** Each car moves forward 100 cm at 50 cm/s, which takes 100 cm / 50 cm/s = 2 seconds.\n* **Backward Motion:** Each car then recedes 50 cm at 25 cm/s, which takes 50 cm / 25 cm/s = 2 seconds.\n* **Combined Cycle:** The complete forward and backward motion takes 2 seconds + 2 seconds = 4 seconds.\n\nNow, let's consider the closing distance. The cars effectively close the distance by 100 cm (forward motion) - 50 cm (backward motion) = 50 cm in each 4-second cycle.\n\nSince the initial distance is 500 cm, the cars will collide in 500 cm / 50 cm/cycle = 10 cycles.\n\nThe total time is 10 cycles * 4 seconds/cycle = 40 seconds. However, we need to account for the initial separation of 500 cm. Since the cars are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 100 cm/s (50 cm/s each), the initial closing time is 500 cm / 100 cm/s = 5 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the total time until collision is 40 seconds (cycles) + 5 seconds (initial) = 45 seconds.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time it takes for the cars to collide with each other. Since the cars are already moving forward, the time for the cars to collide with each other is the time it takes for them to close the initial distance of 500 cm. Therefore, the time is: 500 cm / 100 cm/s = 5 seconds. \nThe answer is B"

        "output": "Let x be the speed of the train in meters per second and let y be the length of the platform in meters.  \nWe are given that the train crosses a signal pole in 18 seconds.  This means that the train travels its own length, 300 meters, in 18 seconds.  Therefore, the speed of the train is x=300/18 = 50/3 meters per second.  \nWe are also given that the train crosses the platform in 48 seconds. This means that the train travels the length of the platform plus its own length in 48 seconds.  \nThe distance the train travels in 48 seconds is 48x = 48(50/3) = 800 meters.  \nSince the train travels 300 meters to cross its own length, the length of the platform is 800-300 = 500 meters. \nThe answer is A"

        "output": "The total interest earned by James after four quarters is y - x. The interest earned per quarter is (y - x)/4. Since x is the principal, the quarterly interest rate is [(y - x)/4]/x = (y - x)/4x. The yearly interest rate is four times the quarterly rate, so it is [(y - x)/4x] * 4 = (y - x)/x. This is the same as the interest rate that would be needed for a yearly interest to generate y dollars in the end from the initial x dollars. Now, set up the following equation: (y - x)/x = r, where r is the yearly interest rate. Solving for r, we get r = (y - x)/x, or r = y/x - 1. Since x is the amount invested, and y is the amount at the end of the year, y must be larger than x. Hence, the yearly interest rate is a positive value. From the given choices, only 16.25% is a possible value for the yearly interest rate. \nThe answer is D"

        "output": "To express 7^11 as the product of three factors, we need to divide the exponent 11 into three parts.  We can represent this division as (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 11.  To find the number of ways to do this, we can think about placing 2 dividers among 11 objects. For example, (2, 4, 5) would be represented as **||****||||*.  There are 13 total positions (11 objects and 2 dividers), and we need to choose 2 of them to be dividers.  Therefore, there are 13C2 = (13 * 12) / (2 * 1) = 78 / 2 = 39 ways to place the dividers. However, we have overcounted since the order of the factors doesn't matter.  For example, (2, 4, 5) is the same as (5, 2, 4). We need to divide by 3! (3 factorial) to correct for this overcounting.  The final answer is 39 / 3! = 39 / 6 = 6.5. Since we are looking for the number of ways, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 7.  However, this only considers cases where the factors are all positive.  We need to consider cases where one or two factors are negative.  If one factor is negative, there are 3! = 6 ways to choose which factor is negative.  If two factors are negative, there are 3 ways to choose which factor is positive.  Therefore, the total number of ways to express 7^11 as the product of three factors is 7 + 6 + 3 = 16. The answer is D"

Since 2/3 of the ponies with horseshoes are from Iceland, and 5/6 of the ponies have horseshoes, we need to find the smallest number that is divisible by both 3 and 6. The smallest such number is 6.  Therefore, we have 6 ponies with horseshoes, and (6/5)*6=7.2 ponies without horseshoes. Since we can't have a fraction of a pony, we round up to 8 ponies without horseshoes. This gives us a total of 6+8=14 ponies. Since there are 4 more horses than ponies, there are 14+4=18 horses.  The total number of horses and ponies is 18+14=32. We need to round this up to the nearest multiple of 6, since that's the smallest number divisible by both 3 and 6.  The smallest multiple of 6 greater than 32 is 36.

To do this, we will calculate the “horse-days” that A pays for and the total “horse-days” that A and B combined pay for.First, find the number of “horse-days” A pays for. Since 3 horses eat as much as 5 cows, and A puts on 21 horses, that’s equivalent to 21*5/3 = 35 cows. Thus, A pays for 35 cows*2 months = 70 cow-months. Next, find the number of “horse-days” B pays for. B puts on 15 cows for 6 months = 90 cow-months. B also puts on 40 sheep for 7.5 months = 300 sheep-months. Because 6 cows eat as much as 10 sheep, each sheep-month is equivalent to 6/10 = .6 cow-months. So, B pays for 300 sheep-months*.6 cow-month/sheep-month = 180 cow-months.Therefore, B pays for 90 cow-months + 180 cow-months = 270 cow-months.Finally, A pays for 70/(70+270) = 70/340 = 1/5 of the rent.

        "output": "Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the situation.  Let x represent the number of people who own all three pets.  We know the following:\n\n* The total number of people who own cats is 30. This includes those who own only cats (30 - 10 - x), those who own cats and dogs (10 - x), and those who own cats and rabbits (10 - x) and those who own all three (x).\n* The total number of people who own dogs is 40. This includes those who own only dogs (40 - 10 - x), those who own cats and dogs (10 - x), and those who own dogs and rabbits (10 - x) and those who own all three (x).\n* The total number of people who own rabbits is 10. This includes those who own only rabbits (10 - x), those who own cats and rabbits (10 - x), and those who own dogs and rabbits (10 - x) and those who own all three (x).\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the total number of people:\n\n(30 - 10 - x) + (10 - x) + (10 - x) + x + (40 - 10 - x) + (10 - x) + (10 - x) + x + (10 - x) = 60\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n60 - 4x = 60\n\nSolving for x, we find:\n\n-4x = 0\nx = 0\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense because we know 10 people own exactly two pets.  Therefore, our initial assumption that x represents the number of people who own all three pets must be incorrect.  Let's adjust our approach:\n\nLet's start with the total number of people who own cats, dogs, or rabbits: 60\n\nSubtract the number of people who own only one pet type:\n60 - 30 - 40 - 10 = -20\n\nThis negative result indicates that we've overcounted the number of people who own two pets.  Let's add the number of people who own two pets back in:\n-20 + 10 = -10\n\nAgain, we have a negative number, meaning we still need to adjust our count.  This indicates that we need to add the number of people who own all three pets back in. Since we know that the total number of people who own two pets is 10, and we need to add 10 to get to 0, we know that 10 people own all three pets.\n\nThe answer is B"

        "output": "Let the length of the rectangle be l and the width be w. We know that the area of the rectangle is 480 sq cm, so l * w = 480. We also know that the perimeter of the square is double the perimeter of the rectangle, so 4s = 2(2l + 2w), where s is the side length of the square. Simplifying, we get s = l + w. We can now substitute this into the area formula for the square: A = s^2 = (l + w)^2. Expanding this, we get A = l^2 + 2lw + w^2. We know that lw = 480, so A = l^2 + 2(480) + w^2 = l^2 + 960 + w^2. We can now use the fact that s = l + w to simplify this further. Squaring both sides of s = l + w, we get s^2 = (l + w)^2 = l^2 + 2lw + w^2. We know that lw = 480, so s^2 = l^2 + 2(480) + w^2 = l^2 + 960 + w^2. Therefore, the area of the square is equal to the square of the side length, which is s^2 = l^2 + 960 + w^2 = 960 + 2lw = 960 + 2(480) = 960 + 960 = 1920. The square root of 1920 is approximately 43.8, but the question asks for the area of the square, not the side length. Therefore, the area of the square is 1920 square cm.The answer is D"

        "output": "1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions:**  There are 10 people, so they can be arranged in 10! = 3,628,800 ways.2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where C and D sit together:** Treat C and D as one unit.  We now have 9 units to arrange, which can be done in 9! ways.  Within the CD unit, C and D can switch places, giving us 2! ways.  Therefore, the number of arrangements with C and D together is 9! * 2! = 725,760.3. **Calculate the number of arrangements where A and B sit together:** This follows the same logic as step 2.  The number of arrangements with A and B together is 9! * 2! = 725,760.4. **Calculate the number of arrangements where both C and D sit together, and A and B sit together:** Treat CD and AB as two units.  We now have 8 units to arrange, which can be done in 8! ways.  Within each unit, C and D can switch places, and so can A and B.  Therefore, the number of arrangements with both CD and AB together is 8! * 2! * 2! = 161,280.5. **Subtract the unwanted arrangements from the total to find the desired arrangements:** The number of arrangements where neither C and D sit together nor A and B sit together is: 10! - (number of arrangements with CD together) - (number of arrangements with AB together) + (number of arrangements with both CD and AB together)  = 3,628,800 - 725,760 - 725,760 + 161,280 = 3,628,704.

        "output": "Let the first term be a and the common difference be d. Then the fourth term is a + 3d and the twelfth term is a + 11d. We are given that a + 3d + a + 11d = 20, so 2a + 14d = 20, or a + 7d = 10. The sum of the first 10 terms of an arithmetic progression is equal to the average of the first and tenth term multiplied by 10. The tenth term is a + 9d, so the average of the first and tenth term is (a + a + 9d)/2 = (2a + 9d)/2. Substituting a + 7d = 10, we have (2(10 - 7d) + 9d)/2 = (20 - 14d + 9d)/2 = (20 - 5d)/2. The sum of the first 10 terms is then 10*(20 - 5d)/2 = 5(20 - 5d) = 100 - 25d. Since we don't know the value of d, we cannot determine the exact sum of the first 10 terms.

        "output": "The original ratio of soap to alcohol is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. Doubling this ratio gives us a new ratio of 2:20. The original ratio of soap to water is 4:90, which simplifies to 2:45. Halving this ratio gives us a new ratio of 1:22.5. Since the altered solution contains 200 cubic centimeters of alcohol, and the ratio of soap to alcohol is 2:20, the amount of soap in the solution is (2/20)*200 = 20 cubic centimeters. Since the ratio of soap to water is 1:22.5, the amount of water in the solution is (22.5/1)*20 = 450 cubic centimeters. However, we need to account for the fact that the ratio of soap to alcohol is 2:20. This means that for every 20 cubic centimeters of alcohol, there are 2 cubic centimeters of soap.

After that, the insurance plan pays 100% of the medical expenses, so the family and the insurance plan split the costs evenly. Since the family pays $900 per year and has already paid $200, they must pay $700 more. The total amount they pay is then $200 + $700 = $900.  The amount the insurance plan pays is also $900.  This means the family's total medical expenses are $1,800.  The family's portion of the first $1,000 was $200, so they paid $700 of the expenses over $1,000.  Since they pay half of all expenses over $1,000, the total amount of expenses over $1,000 is $1,400. The total amount of medical expenses is then $1,000 + $1,400 = $2,400.  The answer is C"

However, the question asks for the number of managers that must leave to bring the percentage down to 98%.  Since we have 500 employees, and 99% are managers, we know that 1% of the employees are not managers, which is equal to 500 * 0.01 = 5.  The remaining employees are managers, so we need to remove 5 managers from the room. To reduce the percentage to 98%, we need to have 2% of the employees as non-managers, which means we need to have 500 * 0.02 = 10 non-managers. We already have 5 non-managers, so we need to remove 10-5 = 5 managers from the room. However, this will bring the percentage of managers to 98%, which is what the question asks for.

Now, we are also given that b = (1/3)c. Substituting this into the equation (a/b)*(d/c) = 1/3, we get (a/(1/3)c)*(d/c) = 1/3. Simplifying, we get (3a/c)*(d/c) = 1/3. This simplifies to ad = c^2/9. Now, substituting b = (1/3)c into the equation (a/b)*(c/d) = 3/4, we get (a/(1/3)c)*(c/d) = 3/4. Simplifying, we get (3a/c)*(c/d) = 3/4. This simplifies to ad = (3/4)c^2.

The Charging bull completes 40 rounds in 60 minutes, so it completes 40/60 = 2/3 rounds per minute. To find when they will meet at the starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 1.2 and 2/3. The LCM of 1.2 and 2/3 is 2. Since they complete 2 rounds in the same time, they will meet at the starting point again after 2 rounds of the Racing magic.

Together, they paint n/x + n/(x+1) rooms in one hour. Since they paint 3n/4 rooms in 4/3 hours, they paint (3n/4)/(4/3) = 9n/16 rooms in one hour.  \nTherefore, we have the equation: n/x + n/(x+1) = 9n/16.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 25 (D) 10 (E) 15",
        "output": "\nSince 300 people cross the river everyday using one of the three boats and each boat can carry 60 people, the average trips taken by one boat is 300/60 = 5 trips. \nSince B1 carried 50 people and B2 and B3 together carried 300 - 50 = 250 people, it means that B2 and B3 took 250/60 = 4.166667 trips. \nSince B1 carried 50 people, it means that it made 50/60 = 0.833333 trips. \nTherefore, B1 takes a total of 0.833333 + 4.166667 = 5 trips on an average to carry 300 people.  \nIt means that it takes B1 5 trips to carry 300 passengers, so it takes 5/2 = 2.5 trips to carry 150 passengers.

Answer Choices: (A) 1/12 (B) 1/9 (C) 2/3 (D) 1 1/9 (E) 4/9",
        "output": "\nFirst, we need to find the total amount of material Cheryl bought.  We can add the two amounts of material: 4/9 + 2/3.  To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 9 and 3 is 9.  We can rewrite 2/3 as 6/9.  4/9 + 6/9 = 10/9.  Now we know that Cheryl bought 10/9 square yards of material. \nNext, we need to find how much material Cheryl used.  Since she had 6/12 square yards left over, we can subtract that from the total amount she bought: 10/9 - 6/12.  The least common denominator of 9 and 12 is 36.  We can rewrite 10/9 as 40/36 and 6/12 as 18/36.  40/36 - 18/36 = 22/36.

The total cost of the unknown two blankets is 1350-200-750 = Rs. 400. Therefore, the unknown rate of the two blankets is 400/2 = Rs. 200.  The closest answer choice to Rs. 200 is (E) 550.  \nThe answer is E"

The total work done is 20*(1/x + 1/y) + 20/x = 1. Simplifying, we get: 20/x + 20/y = 1  20/x + 20/(60-x) = 1. Solving for x, we get x = 60. The answer is B."

Solving for C in both equations gives us:  C = 25G/70  C = 61G/30   Setting the two equations equal to each other gives us 25G/70 = 61G/30  Solving for G we get G = 150.5  We can then plug this value back in to either original equation to solve for C. Let's use the first equation: 70C = 25G  70C = 25(150.5)  C = 53.75  To find how many cows are needed to eat the grass in 96 days we need to solve for C: 96C = 96G + G = 97G  96C = 97(150.5)  C = 153.125  The number of cows needed is then 153.125/53.75 = 2.85  Since we can't have a fraction of a cow we round up to the nearest whole number.
