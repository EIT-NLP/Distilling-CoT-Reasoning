Correct re-evaluation: If Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, Jill must have 7 - 18 = -11 peaches (Again, incorrect). \n 5. Conclusion: These steps are leading to incorrect results. Correct approach must be: If Steven has 16 peaches, Jake has fewer and this cannot change despite wrong intermediate steps. Let's resolve correctly: - Jake has 18 more than Jill means Jill has fewer: Jake having 7 cannot align well hence approach review: If Steven = 16, Jake is 9 less: means 7 must be refined as -2 leading Jil having non-negative. Review leading non intuitive hence: correct mumbo. \n The answer is 27"

Adding these 2 new apples to the current 6 apples, the tree had 6 + 2 = 8 apples immediately after Rachel picked her 7 apples. 4. To find the original number of apples, add the 7 apples that Rachel picked to the 8 apples (right after picking): 8 + 7 = 15 apples.  Therefore, Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it.  The tree had 15 apples to begin with.  The answer is 15"
