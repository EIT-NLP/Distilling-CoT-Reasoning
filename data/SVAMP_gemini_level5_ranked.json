Together, they have 14 apples, so x + (x + 4) = 14. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 14. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 2x = 10. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 5. Therefore, Jackie has 5 apples. \n2. **Finding Adam's apples:** Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, he has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. \n3. **Finding Bob's apples:** Together, Adam and Jackie have 9 + 5 = 14 apples. Bob has 6 more apples than them, so he has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. \nThe answer is 20"

        "output": "First find the total number of cards Nell had originally. 309 baseball cards + 356 Ace cards = 665 cards. Then subtract the number of cards she has left from the original total to find the number of cards given away: 665 cards - 415 cards = 250 cards.  To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she gave away, we need to find the difference between the number of baseball cards she started with and the number of Ace cards she started with: 309 baseball cards - 356 Ace cards = -47. The negative sign means that she gave away more Ace cards than baseball cards. Since she gave away 250 cards total, and 47 more Ace cards were given away than baseball cards, she gave away 250 cards - 47 cards = 203 Ace cards. Finally, subtract the number of Ace cards given away from the original number of Ace cards to find how many Ace cards she has left: 356 Ace cards - 203 Ace cards = 153 Ace cards.  Now, subtract the number of Ace cards she has left from the number of baseball cards she has left to find the answer. 415 cards - 153 Ace cards = 262 baseball cards.  Therefore, Nell has 262 baseball cards - 153 Ace cards = 109 more baseball cards than Ace cards.  The answer is 109"

However, this is impossible as we cannot have a negative number of trees. This means that all 3 trees that were planted died. Therefore, the number of trees that died is 13, and the number of trees that survived is 0. So, the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived is 13 - 0 = 13.  The answer is 13"

        "output": "The problem gives us information about the number of visitors on two days, but we are asked to find the total number of visitors in 57 days.  The information about the number of paintings is irrelevant. To solve this problem, we can use the following steps: 1. Calculate the total number of visitors in the two given days. 2. We can estimate the number of visitors per day.  3. Finally, multiply the estimated number of visitors per day by 57 days to obtain the total number of visitors. Since we are asked for an estimate, we need to simplify the information. For instance, 188 visitors can be approximated to 200 visitors, and 557 visitors can be approximated to 560. We know that 560 visitors came in one day, and 200 visitors came in another day, that means there were approximately 760 visitors in two days.  A rough estimate of visitors per day can be 760 / 2 = 380.  Multiply the approximate number of visitors per day by 57 days: 380 visitors/day * 57 days = 21660 visitors  The total number of visitors is 21660 visitors in 57 days.  The answer is 745"

Since 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, we can represent the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes as 'x + 63'. The total number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon is 457. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 63) = 457. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 63 = 457.

Therefore, to find out how many more children got on than got off, we add the initial number of children to the number of children who got on: 5 + 14 = 19. Now, we subtract the number of children who got off from this sum to find the difference: 19 - 63 = -44. However, the difference cannot be negative, so we know that 44 more children got off than got on. To find out how many more got on than off, we reverse the difference: 44. The answer is 9"

He currently has 33 bottle caps, but he found 63 more at the park, so before that he had 33 - 63 = -30 bottle caps.  However, this answer doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of bottle caps. This means he had 33 bottle caps after throwing away some.

        "output": "The mailman needs to deliver 38 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks, which means he has a total of 38 * 78 = 2964 pieces of junk mail.  Since there are 19 houses on each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses to find the number of pieces each house should receive. The total number of houses is 78 blocks * 19 houses/block = 1482 houses. Therefore, each house should receive 2964 pieces of junk mail / 1482 houses = 2 pieces of junk mail. The answer is 2"
