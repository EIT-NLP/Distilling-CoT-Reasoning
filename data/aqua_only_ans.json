In the second month, Store A's revenues were $9,000 higher than Store B's revenues. If Store A's average (arithmetic mean) monthly revenue for the three months was $4,000 greater than Store B's average monthly revenue, then Store B's revenue in the third month was how much greater than Store A's revenue? Answer Choices: (A) $14,000 (B) $15,000 (C) $42,000 (D) $46,000 (E) $57,000",
        "output": "CIt may be tempting to come up with a lot of variables, one each for each month's revenue for each company. However, focus on the differences. In the first month, the difference was +60 in favor of A. (Note that we can drop the thousands since every number in the question is in terms of thousands.) In the second, the difference was +9 in favor of A. The average was +4 in favor of A. With these numbers, use the average formula to find the third month (T): (60 + 9 + T)/3 = 4 69 + T = 12 T = -57 Since positive numbers indicate a difference in favor of A, negative numbers are in favor of B. -57 represents a $57,000 advantage in favor of Store B. Choice E is correct."

        "output": "A Explanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average B= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A. NOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility."

        "output": "A Explanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average V= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A. NOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility."

In order for the sum of the numbers on the two balls to be even, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd; one even and one odd number would add to an odd number. The probability of selecting two even numbers is: 1/2 * 1/2= 1/4 The probability of selecting two odd numbers is also: 1/2 * 1/2= 1/4 Adding both probabilities gives P=1/4+1/4= 1/2 , or 50%, as the probability that the sum of the numbers will be even.

After one turn the spider will be on a diagonal corner of a common face as the ant. So the mean number of turns from the x position is one more than the mean number from the y position: E(x)=1+E(y). Once at a y position there is a 2/3 chance it will then move to a z position, and a 1/3 chance back to an x position: E(y)=(2/3)*(1+E(z))+(1/3)*(1+E(x)). If the spider arrives at a z position there is a 1/3 chance it will move to the ant, and a 2/3 chance it will move back to a y position: E(z)=(1/3)*1+(2/3)*(1+E(y)).
