        "output": "Sediments in rivers are primarily deposited by the action of water and weather. Weathering processes break down rocks and soil into smaller particles, which are then transported and deposited by the river's current.  Global warming can indirectly affect sedimentation rates, but it's not the direct cause of sediment deposition. Fish and animals contribute minimally to the large-scale sediment layers. Therefore, weather-related degradation (erosion and weathering) is the most significant factor. \nThe answer is B"

        "output": "Westerlies are prevailing winds that blow from west to east.  Air masses are large bodies of air with relatively uniform temperature and humidity.  Gravity affects air masses, but doesn't stop their movement. Currents, in a general sense, are flows of fluids, which includes air. However, the meandering of air currents, meaning the curving and swirling patterns of air movement, is what can block or redirect the path of a large air mass pushed by westerlies. Sunlight is a source of energy that drives weather systems but doesn't directly obstruct the movement of air masses. The answer is B"

        "output": "A red giant is a star that has expanded significantly. This expansion is a result of the star running out of hydrogen fuel in its core, causing the core to contract and heat up.  This increased heat causes the outer layers of the star to expand drastically. While the core contracts, the overall size of the star increases significantly, meaning its mass is spread over a larger volume. However, the star still retains most of its original mass.  The gravitational force is proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.  Even though the star is less dense, the overall mass remains relatively constant. Thus the gravitational force, while spread over a larger volume,  does not significantly decrease overall. In fact, the initial core contraction increases the gravitational pull at the core. The effect of increased mass concentration in the core will be greater than the effect of the expansion of the star.  Therefore, the overall gravitational effect is a net increase. The answer is A"

        "output": "Molten lava is already in a liquid state.  Coming into contact with a car, which is at a much lower temperature, will not cause the lava to freeze (A), turn into a gas (B), or fly into the sky (D). The contact would cause a heat transfer, but the lava's temperature would not suddenly reach its melting point (C) because it's already molten. However, the interaction would cause a temperature change in the lava, although not to its melting point.  The most accurate answer among the options is C, as the heat transfer would represent a change in temperature, even if not directly to its melting point. The lava will cool down, and eventually solidify. The melting point is a specific temperature at which a substance changes state, and since it's already molten, a melting point change is the least inaccurate option presented. \n The answer is C"
