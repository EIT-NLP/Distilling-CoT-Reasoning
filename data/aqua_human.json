To start, 450 is divisible by 9, so we can figure out the AVERAGE number of tiles per row. That is 450/9 = 50. Since we're dealing with a set of 9 consecutive integers that differ by 2 each, we know that the '5th row' will have 50 tiles (the average).

        "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step. Let's say the two cars have speeds V1 and V2. The fact that they are moving in opposite direction means that their relative speed is (V1 + V2). In other words, any gap between them will be changing in size at a rate of (V1 + V2). It doesn't matter whether they are moving toward each other or away from each other. If they are approaching each other, the gap between them is decreasing at a rate of (V1 + V2). If they are moving away from each other, the gap between them is increasing at a rate of (V1 + V2). Either way, the number for the rate of change remains the same. Here, the two cars approach a distance 50 mi, then move away from each other another distance of 50 miles. That's a total distance of 100 miles in 1.5 hr, which gives a rate of: R = (100 mi)/(1.5) = 66.67 mph That's the rate of change of the gap, so it must equal the sum of the speeds of the two cars. One of the speeds is x, and let's call the other y. We want y. x + y = 66.67 y = 66.67 - x The answer is A"

Then start with the smallest amount and work your way outwards. We are told that two out of every 30 defective chips have a defective processor. Let x be the total number of defective processors in the batch. Because we know 2 out of every 30 defective chips will have defective processors, and the total number of defective processors in the batch is 30, we can write out an equation: (2/30)x = 30. This can be simplified to (1/15)x = 30. Multiplying each side by 15, we arrive at x = 450. This tells us that there are 450 defective chips in the whole batch. Because we know that 1 out of every 1000 chips is defective, we can set up a proportion. If 1 out of every 5000 chips is defective, then 450 out of y chips would be defective, where y is the total number of chips in the batch. This can be set up as an equation as follows: 1/5000 = 450/y.

Here, for example, we're asked for.... 7^6 + 7^6 + 7^6 + 7^6 = Now, the GMAT doesn't really expect us to calculate this sum (but we could if we had to), but we are expected to find a way to organize this information... If, instead of all of those exponents, we had... X + X + X + X = What would the sum be? Clearly, it would be 4(X) = 4X.....since we're just combining 'like' terms. Take that same idea with this prompt and you have... 7^6 + 7^6 + 7^6 + 7^6 = 7(7^6) This can be re-written as... (7^1)(7^6) ...and now we can use exponent rules; since we're MULTIPLYING 'bases' that are the same, we ADD the exponents... (7^1)(7^6) = 7^7 Final The answer is  A"

        "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step. A 61-sided convex polygon has 61 vertices. If we examine a single vertex, we can see that we can connect it with 58 other vertices to create a diagonal. Note that we can't connect the vertex to itself and we can't connect it to its adjacent vertices, since this would not create a diagonal. If each of the 61 vertices can be connected with 58 vertices to create a diagonal then the total number of diagonals would be (61)(58) = 3538 However, we must recognize that we have counted every diagonal twice. To account for counting each diagonal twice, we must divide 3538 by 2 to get 1769. The answer is B."

The distance of Z15 is equal to five times the distance of X13 (we established that x13 is the baseline and thus, it's measurements are d, s, t) S(T+2) = 5(S*T)What clues would I have to know to set up the equation in this fashion? Is it because I am better off setting two identical distances together? ST+2S = 5ST T+2 = 5T 2=4T t= 1/2 We are looking for distance (d=s*t) so we need to solve for speed now that we have time. Speed y14 - speed x13 Speed = d/t 3d/t - d/t = 8000 (remember, t is the same because both asteroids were observed for the same amount of time) 2d = 8000 2 = 4000 d=s*t d=4000*(1/2) d=2000 The answer is E"

This means that your goal is to get the equations in terms of B and J so that you can solve for the expression B - J. Taking the first equation and solving for B, you have B = M - 4. Taking the second equation and solving for J you have J = T - 12, and then with the third equation you can replace T with 4 + M so that both B and J are in terms of M: J = (4 + M) - 12. So if B = M - 4 and J = M - 8, then: B - J = (M - 4) - (M - 8) B - J = M - 4 - M + 8 (remove the parentheses by distributing the multiplication) B - J = 4, so The answer is B."

Thus, to determine how many grams of sucrose would be in the container when we have 60 cubic centimeters of solution, we can set up a proportion. We can say: “10 grams of sucrose is to 100 cubic centimeters of solution as x grams of sucrose is to 60 cubic centimeters of solution.” Let’s now set up the proportion and solve for x. 10/100 = x/60 When we cross multiply we obtain: (10)(60) = 100x 600 = 100x 6.00 = x There are 6.00 grams of sucrose in the solution in the container.

Therefore, a + (a + 20) + (a + 20) = 240 (b and c are equal and b, the median, is a + 20) Or 3a = 200 or a = 66.66 So, b = c = 66.66+ 20 = 86.66 However, we know that these numbers are all integers. Therefore, a, b, and c cannot take these values. So, the least value for c with this constraint is NOT likely to be when c = b Let us increment c by 1. Let c = (b + 1) In this scenario, a + (a + 20) + (a + 21) = 240 Or 3a = 199. The value of the numbers is not an integer in this scenario as well. Let us increment c again by 1. i.e., c = b + 2 Now, a + (a + 20) + (a + 22) = 240 Or 3a = 198 or a = 66 If a = 66, b = 86 and c = 88. The least value for c that satisfies all these conditions is 88.

When x = 1, 3, 5,7 ....93 the value of the express will be zero. i.e., for odd values of x, the expression will be zero. We need to evaluate whether the expression will be negative for all even numbers upto 93 Let x = 2; first term (x-1) > 0; remaining 46 terms < 0. The product of one positive number and 46 negative numbers will be positive (product of even number of negative terms will be positive). So, x = 2 does not satisfy the condition. Let x = 4; (x-1) and (x-3) are positive; the remaining 45 terms < 0. The product of two positive numbers and 45 negative numbers will be negative. So, x = 4 satisfies the condition. Let x = 6; first 3 terms (x-1), (x-3), and (x-5) are positive and the remaining 44 terms are negative. Their product > 0. So, x = 6 does not satisfy the condition.

        "output": "Let's reason about the multi-choice question. This problem is a general word translation. We first define variables and then set up equations. We can define the following variables: F = the weight of the first lift S = the weight of the second lift We are given that the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 900 pounds. We sum the two variables to obtain: F + S = 900 We are also given that twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift. We express this as: 2F = 300 + S 2F – 300 = S We can now plug in (2F – 300) for S into the first equation, so we have: F + 2F – 300 = 900 3F = 1,200 F = 400 The answer is E."

Therefore, a + (a + 13) + (a + 13) = 84 (b and c are equal and b, the median, is a + 13) Or 3a = 58 or a = 19.33 So, b = c = 19.33+ 13= 32.33 However, we know that these numbers are all integers. Therefore, a, b, and c cannot take these values. So, the least value for c with this constraint is NOT likely to be when c = b Let us increment c by 1. Let c = (b + 1) In this scenario, a + (a + 13) + (a + 14) = 84 Or 3a = 57or a=19 The value of the numbers is an integer. If a = 19, b = 32 and c = 33.

Let's list the numbers from 61 to 69. 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 Immediately we can eliminate the EVEN NUMBERS because they are divisible by 2 and thus are not prime. We are now left with: 61, 63, 65, 67, 69 We can next eliminate 65 because 65 is a multiple of 5. We are now left with 61, 63, 67, 69. To eliminate any remaining values, we would look at those that are multiples of 3. If you don’t know an easy way to do this, just start with a number that is an obvious multiple of 3, such as 60, and then keep adding 3. We see that 60, 63, 66, 69 are all multiples of 3 and therefore are not prime. Thus, we can eliminate 63 and 69 from the list because they are not prime. Finally, we are left with 61 and 67, and we must determine whether they are divisible by 7. They are not, and therefore they must be both prime. Thus, the sum q of 61 and 67 is 128. The answer is B."

Think about the question this way: we know that there is a total of 5 to be spread among the 4 digits, we just have to determine the number of ways it can be spread. Let X represent a sum of 1, and | represent a seperator between two digits. As a result, we will have 5 X's (digits add up to the 5), and 3 |'s (3 digit seperators). So, for example: XX|X|X|X = 2111 ||XXX|XX = 0032 etc. There are 8C3 ways to determine where to place the separators. Hence, The answer is 8C3 = 56. D"

        "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step. Correct The answer is A Explanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average B= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A. NOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility."

If 80% of Republicans (which is (60*0.8) = 48) and 25% of Democrats (40*0.25 = 10) voted for candidate X, means that out of total of 100 voters; 58 (48 + 10) voters voted for candidate X and 42 voted for candidate Y.

Work with probabilities: Choosing two dogs, we can have either one dog of type B or none (we cannot have two dogs both of typeB. The probability of choosing one dog of type B and one of type A is 3/9 * 6/8 * 2 = 1/2 (the factor of 2 for the two possibilities BA and AB).

Think about the question this way: we know that there is a total of 5 to be spread among the 4 digits, we just have to determine the number of ways it can be spread. Let X represent a sum of 1, and | represent a seperator between two digits. As a result, we will have 5 X's (digits add up to the 5), and 3 |'s (3 digit seperators). So, for example: XX|X|X|X = 2111 ||XXX|XX = 0032 etc. There are 8C3 ways to determine where to place the separators. Hence, The answer is 8C3 = 56. D"

However that is totally wrong as the wind has only supported Josh for 3 minutes while it has acted adversely for 4 minutes. Thus first we must calculate the distance if he would have travelled for equal time along with wind i.e. 4 minutes. Clearly he would have travelled a mile and 1/3 of a mile in 4 minutes. Now adding the total distance in eight minutes i.e. 2 and 1/3 mile we can get his actual speed and time. Thus the actual time for a single mile will be 3 minute and 25 (5/7) seconds. The answer is A"

        "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step. Correct The answer is A Explanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average V= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A. NOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility."

        "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step. We know that to find the last two digits, we need to find the remainder we get when we divide the product by 100. Remainder of (63*35*37*82*71*41)/ 100 Note that we can simplify this expression by canceling out the 5 and 2 in the numerator and denominator. But before we do that, here is an important note: Note: We cannot just cancel off the common terms in the numerator and denominator to get the remainder. But, if we want to cancel off to simplify the question, we can do it, provided we remember to multiply it back again. So say, we want to find the remainder when 14 is divided by 10 i.e. 14/10 (remainder 4). But we cancel off the common 2 to get 7/5. The remainder here will be 2 which is not the same as the remainder obtained by dividing 14 by 10. But if we multiply 2 back by 2 (the number we canceled off), the remainder will become 2*2 = 4 which is correct. Take another example to reinforce this – what is the remainder when 85 is divided by 20? It is 5. We might rephrase it as – what is the remainder when 17 is divided by 4 (cancel off 5 from the numerator and the denominator). The remainder in this case is 1. We multiply the 5 back to 1 to get the remainder as 5 which is correct. So keeping this very important point in mind, let’s go ahead and cancel the common 5 and 2. We need the Remainder of (63*7*37*41*71*41*5*2)/10*5*2 Remainder of (63*7*37*41*71*41)/10 Now using concept 2, let’s write the numbers in form of multiples of 10 Remainder of (60+3)*7*(30+7)*(40+1)*(70+1)*(40+1)/10 Remainder of 3*7*7*1*1*1/10 Remainder of 147/10 = 7 Now remember, we had canceled off 10 so to get the actual remainder so we need to multiply by 10: 7*10 = 70. When 63*35*37*82*71*41 is divided by 100, the remainder is 70. So the last two digits of 63*35*37*82*71*41 must be 80. The answer is E"

Since s and c must be integers (they represent the number of oil changes finished) this question is asking you to find a common multiple of 15 and 10. The question asks for the first time they began a car simultaneously, so you must find the least common multiple and subtract. The least common multiple of 15 and 10 is 30, so in the context of the question, this would be 30 minutes.

Consider 12 different boxes aligned as shown and check three of them:Here, we have checked the first, fifth, and tenth boxes. Each such diagram corresponds to a way of investing the remaining money as follows. We order the mutual funds. Count the number of unchecked boxes to the left of the first checkmark.

Make additional investments (beyond the required minimal investments) of k1 thousand dollars in the first fund, k2 thousand dollars in the second fund, k3 thousand dollars in the third fund, and k4 thousand dollars in the fourth fund.

The prompt gives us a couple of facts to work with: 1) A and B are positive INTEGERS 2) A/B = 2.86 We can use these facts to figure out POSSIBLE values of A and B. The prompt asks us for what MUST be a divisor of A. Since we're dealing with a fraction, A and B could be an infinite number of different integers, so we have to make both as SMALL as possible; in doing so, we'll be able to find the divisors that ALWAYS divide in (and eliminate the divisors that only SOMETIMES divide in). The simplest place to start is with... A = 286 B = 100 286/100 = 2.86 These values are NOT the smallest possible values though (since they're both even, we can divide both by 2)... A = 143 B = 50 143/50 = 2.86 There is no other way to reduce this fraction, so A must be a multiple of 143 and B must be an equivalent multiple of 50. At this point though, the value of B is irrelevant to the question. We're asked for what MUST divide into A.... Since A is a multiple of 143, we have to 'factor-down' 143. This gives us (11)(13). So BOTH of those integers MUST be factors of A. You'll find the match in the answer choices. Final The answer is  B"

        "output": "Let's reason about the multi-choice question. My friend, every single odd number greater than can be written either as 4Q+1 or as 4Q+3. If you divide any odd number by 4, you will get a remainder of either 1 or 3. That's not a rule unique to prime numbers at all. The 6Q+1 or 6Q-1 rule is basically every odd number that is not divisible by three, so it narrows the search a little. Here's how I thought about the problem. First, eliminate all the even numbers and the odd multiples of 5 in that range. That leaves us with: {201, 203, 207, 209, 211, 213, 217, 219} Eliminate the four multiples of 3. Notice that 21 is a multiple of 3, so 210 is also a multiple of 3. If we add or subtract 3 or 9, we get more multiples of three. When we eliminate those, we are left with. {203, 209, 211, 217} Now, notice that a cool thing about this range is that 210 is also a multiple 7 (again, because 21 is a multiple of 7). This means that 210 - 7 = 203 210 + 7 = 217 Those two numbers are also multiples of 7, so eliminate them from the list. Now, we are left with {209, 211}. We've already checked all the prime numbers less than 10, so we know that neither of these numbers is divisible by anything less than 10. We have to check 11 now. We know that 22 is a multiple of 11, so 220 is also a multiple of 11. This means that 220 - 11 = 209 is also a multiple of 11. We can eliminate this from the list also. That leaves us with just 211. There's no zero option in the question, so this must be a prime number. The answer is A"

The stem wants to say that X is a PRIME NUMBER . because any prime Number has no factor grater than 1 and Itself . On the other hand the stem says that X COULD get how many different number NOT MUST get different number ( this is very important issue ) AS our friends say, if we simplify Numerator more we can obtain : 5^12 ( 5^3-1) = 5^12 (124) = 5^12 (31*2*2) divided by x and we are told that this fraction is An integer . so, X COULD Be ( not Must be) 5 , 31 ,or 2 !!! so , X could get 2 different values and answer is C...."

A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean, whereas high standard deviation indicates that the data are spread out over a large range of values. So when we add numbers, which are far from the mean we are stretching the set making SD bigger and when we add numbers which are close to the mean we are shrinking the set making SD smaller. According to the above adding two numbers which are closest to the mean will shrink the set most, thus decreasing SD by the greatest amount. Closest to the mean are 8 and 8 (actually these numbers equal to the mean) thus adding them will definitely shrink the set, thus decreasing SD. The answer is E."

Translating this into two mathematical expressions we can say, where G is the total number of students in the gym class, that: G/8 = integer and G/12 = integer This means that G is a multiple of both 8 and 12. We are asked to determine the lowest number of students in the class, or the lowest value for variable “G”. Because we know that G is a multiple of 8 and of 12, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 12. Although there are technical ways for determining the least common multiple, the easiest method is to analyze the multiples of 8 and 12 until we find one in common. Starting with 8, we have: 8, 16, 24, 32 For 12, we have: 12, 24 For the multiples of 12, we stopped at 24, because we see that 24 is also a multiple of 8.

Next, the units digit of 3 in positive integer power repeats in blocks of four {3, 9, 7, 1}: 3^1=3 (the units digit is 3) 3^2=9 (the units digit is 9) 3^3=27 (the units digit is 7) 3^4=81 (the units digit is 1) 3^5=243 (the units digit is 3 again!) ... Thus: The units digit of 3^53 is the same as the units digit of 3^3, so 7 (53 divided by the cyclicity of 4 gives the remainder of 3). The units digit of 3^33 is the same as the units digit of 3^1, so 3 (33 divided by the cyclicity of 4 gives the remainder of 1). Therefore the units digit of (33)^53 + (53)^33 is 7 + 7 = 4.

Let's list the numbers from 61 to 69. 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 Immediately we can eliminate the EVEN NUMBERS because they are divisible by 2 and thus are not prime. We are now left with: 61, 63, 65, 67, 69 We can next eliminate 65 because 65 is a multiple of 5. We are now left with 61, 63, 67, 69. To eliminate any remaining values, we would look at those that are multiples of 3. If you don’t know an easy way to do this, just start with a number that is an obvious multiple of 3, such as 60, and then keep adding 3. We see that 60, 63, 66, 69 are all multiples of 3 and therefore are not prime. Thus, we can eliminate 63 and 69 from the list because they are not prime. Finally, we are left with 61 and 67, and we must determine whether they are divisible by 7. They are not, and therefore they must be both prime. Thus, the sum t of 61 and 67 is 128. The answer is B."

If the spider started at a corner diagonally on the same face as the ant the answer would be 9, and if the spider started at an adjacent corner the answer would be 7. Let x=number of turns to reach ant from starting point. Let y=number of turns to reach ant from diagonal corner on same face as ant. Let z=number of turns to reach ant from an adjacent corner to ant. After one turn the spider will be on a diagonal corner of a common face as the ant. So the mean number of turns from the x position is one more than the mean number from the y position: E(x)=1+E(y). Once at a y position there is a 2/3 chance it will then move to a z position, and a 1/3 chance back to an x position: E(y)=(2/3)*(1+E(z))+(1/3)*(1+E(x)). If the spider arrives at a z position there is a 1/3 chance it will move to the ant, and a 2/3 chance it will move back to a y position: E(z)=(1/3)*1+(2/3)*(1+E(y)).
