Let's denote the number of baseball cards Nell has now as B and the number of Ace cards she has now as A. We know: 1. B + A = 415 2. (309 - B) + (356 - A) = 250 From (309 - B) + (356 - A)= 250 We can simplify it as (665 - (B + A)) = 250 (Since initially she had 665 and now 415) = So, B - A = 266  This implies that Nell has 266 more baseball cards than Ace cards left.
