        "output": " Audible vibrations, also known as sound waves, generally travel through gases, liquids, and solids. In the context of this question, nitrogen and oxygen represent the gases we commonly refer to as air. Sound travels through air (a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen) freely, enabling us to hear sounds at a distance. Whereas, materials like brick, ground, and mountains are solids where sound transmission differs and is generally less efficient for perceptible audible vibrations. Therefore, audible vibrations can travel freely through air, which is represented by nitrogen and oxygen. The answer is B"
