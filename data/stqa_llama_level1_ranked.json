Since 20 < 64, it's possible to arrange them to fully cover some of rows and columns, but not all of the board's squares at once. However, assuming ideal packing efficiency and considering that you can snugly fit about 2-3 rows and columns (depending on their orientation) within a square with a single pea each, it's theoretically possible to make two rows and three columns (6 total peas), or three rows and two columns (6 total peas), then substitute some with more peasants in next layers while maintaining coverage everywhere else... It would take only 18-19 peas to roughly 'cover' majority of surface area (>90%). Thus, we're left with at least one extra 'pea' from those original twenty to fill any gaps that remain after using eighteen-ish for most area coverage. So yes, essentially you can nearly fully tile almost all areas without leaving significant gaps - thus technically yes for covering most part of board space but generally not perfectly fitting into each square’s edges perfectly due to shape differences between peas and square boundaries...

To calculate toxic effects, we should consider ionizing radiation and chemical toxicity: alpha particles emitted by U-238 (uranium's primary component) are blocked by skin/human tissues; thus, external exposure isn't lethal; ingested amounts would need to be substantial (>100mg or even >1000mg) for damage from radiation and chemical toxicity combined, which our 'pellet' doesn't reach given its calculated volume or assumed density range (~11g/cm3); hence it's highly unlikely to cause death through either means alone or combined.
