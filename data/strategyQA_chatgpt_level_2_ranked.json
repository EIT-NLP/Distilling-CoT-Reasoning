To convert this to Gigabytes, we use the fact that 1 Byte = 8 bits, so 1 Gbps = 0.125 GBps (Gigabytes per second). Next, we calculate the amount of data that can be uploaded in a fortnight (14 days). There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so in 14 days, there are 1,209,600 seconds. By multiplying the upload speed by the number of seconds in a fortnight, we get 0.125 GBps * 1,209,600 seconds = 151,200 GB. Since 151,200 GB is much greater than 1,000 GB, it is evident that Centurylink's max internet plan can indeed upload 1,000 GB in a fortnight. The answer is True"
