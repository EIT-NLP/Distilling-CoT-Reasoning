Calculate the total number of cards Nell originally had: 309 baseball cards + 356 Ace cards = 665 cards. 2. Calculate the number of cards given to Jeff: 665 cards (original) - 415 cards (remaining) = 250 cards. 3. Determine the number of baseball cards and Ace cards remaining: Let B be the number of baseball cards Nell has now, and A be the number of Ace cards she has now. We know that B + A = 415 cards. 4. We also know she had a total of 309 baseball cards originally, and 356 Ace cards originally. She gave away a certain number of both types to end up with 415 total cards. Since the given answer states that Nell has 266 more baseball cards than Ace cards, we setup the equation: B = A + 266. 5. Substitute B in the equation (B + A = 415): (A + 266) + A = 415 which simplifies to 2A + 266 = 415. 6. Solve for A: 2A = 415 - 266, 2A = 149, A = 74.5. 7. Thus, substituting back: B = 74.5 + 266, B = 340.5. Therefore, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than Ace cards. The answer is 266"

        "output": " To determine how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to break down the situation step by step.1. Identify the total number of customers originally: 3.2. Realize that after some customers left, the number of customers increased to 4. This implies additional customers arrived.3. Calculate the increase in customers: 4 (remaining customers) - 3 (original customers) = 1 (new customer).4. Thus, the total number of remaining customers should be reconsidered by adding the newly arrived customer(s) to the left customers. Therefore: 3 (original) - left customers = remaining customers - newly arrived customers.4 - 1 = 3. Now, we calculate the difference between the customers stayed and left. The difference is 4 (stayed) - (-1) (left) = 5 (more stayed). The answer is 5"

        "output": " To determine how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we first need to understand the relationship between the flour and sugar needed. According to the problem, the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. Therefore, if Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up the equation:Let F be the cups of flour still needed, and S be the cups of sugar still needed.According to the problem, F = S + 8.Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour in total, and Mary already put in some cups of flour, let’s denote the flour she has added so far as F_added. The total flour required minus the flour already added equals the flour still needed:6 - F_added = F.We also know that the total sugar needed minus the sugar already added equals the sugar still needed:13 - S_added = S,According to the flour equation and relationship to sugar, we substitute 13 - S_added into F = S + 8:F = (13 - S_added) + 8 = 21 - S_added,Now, if we assume S_added is 0 since the problem doesn’t specify any already added, the equation becomes:F = 21,So, Mary needs 21 more cups of flour.The answer is 21"

Marco's strawberries now weigh 12 pounds. Let's denote the original weight of his dad's strawberries as D. Since Marco and his dad's strawberries together weighed 36 pounds, we can set up the equation: Marco's weight + Dad's original weight = 36 pounds, 12 pounds + D = 36 pounds. Solving for D gives us: D = 36 pounds - 12 pounds, D = 24 pounds. However, on the way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, his dad's remaining strawberries weigh: 24 pounds - 8 pounds = 16 pounds. The answer is 16"
