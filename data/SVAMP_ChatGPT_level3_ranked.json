Next, find the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff:665 (total initial cards) - 415 (cards she has left) = 250 (cards given to Jeff).3. Let B be the number of baseball cards Nell has now, and A be the number of Ace cards she has now:B + A = 415.4. Also, note that the total number of baseball cards and Ace cards given to Jeff is 250:(309 - B) + (356 - A) = 250.5. Simplify the above equation:665 - (B + A) = 250.6. We know that B + A = 415 from step 3:665 - 415 = 250.7. Simplify this to verify correctness:250 = 250 (This holds true).8. Therefore, the number of baseball cards B and the number of Ace cards A that she has now can be expressed in terms of initial cards minus X and Y respectively.9. From these, we know how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has:(309 - B) = B' since 309 - B' = B.356 - B - Y = A,Combining both terms, how many more baseball cards remains:hence B' - (356 - B - Y) = Answer = 266 for True.The answer is 266"

        "output": " To find out how much money they made from selling the t-shirts, we first need to calculate the new price of each t-shirt after the price increase. This can be done by adding the initial price ($201) and the additional price ($217). Therefore, the new price per t-shirt is 201 + 217 = 418. Next, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold (14) by the new price per t-shirt (418). Therefore, 418 * 14 = 5852. The answer is 5852"

        "output": " To determine the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence, we start with the initial count: 3 birds and 2 storks. Then, 5 more birds join them. So, the total number of birds and storks is the sum of 3 birds, 2 storks, and 5 additional birds. Therefore, 3 + 2 + 5 = 10. The answer is 10"
